Yes folks Betaflight, albeit an earlier version than current, was the firmware behind the most recent record breaking success story for the “Fastest ground speed by a battery-powered remote-controlled (RC) quadcopter.”. The Guinness World Records has granted the title to Ryan Lademann (USA), using his custom built drone called the XLR V3 Red. This drone powered its way to the record books by hitting 224mph (360kmh). Yes thats right folks this drone nearly hit 200knots (195knots). Many light aircraft would love to reach those speeds. The record attempt was made in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA, on 8 November 2022. What a way to finish out the year. The team here at Betaflight congratulate Ryan on his successful attempt, and are very happy the firmware played a small part in that success. now how can we get Ryan to update his firmware ;). For some more details on the attempt: For a clip of the attempt: https://youtu.be/J3WwtByvSI0?t=21 If your are so inclined the black box log of the attempt can be analysed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K1JLV_f3W0z1dRSP84hw3UEqv5Fc_b5P/view Don't forget to check out Ryan's page for more details on the drone: https://quad-star-drones.com/xlr-v3/ And last but not least, the details from GWR themselves: https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/464800-fastest-ground-speed-by-a-battery-powered-remote-controlled-quadcopter","keywords":""},{"title":"Approved Partner Program","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/partner","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Introduction​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Approved Partner Program","url":"/partner#introduction","content":"Betaflight is an open source firmware project, and runs on third party electronics hardware. This means that the Betaflight firmware development team does not have control over the hardware designs or specifications. However the performance of the firmware is related to the hardware on which it runs. Thus for the sake of the FPV community, this program aims to minimize issues that users have, by offering recommendations and guidance to manufacturers direct from the development team. Hardware manufacturers can now benefit from active engagement with the Betaflight development team - giving them access to their skills, experience and advice - to produce better hardware and more successful designs. "},{"title":"Betaflight 4.3 - 'Recommended Direction'​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Approved Partner Program","url":"/partner#betaflight-43---recommended-direction","content":"For version 4.3 a team of Betaflight developers started a 'Hardware Specification' program discussing a recommended direction for current and future hardware design and development. The document 'Manufacturer Design Guidelines' is available here, and represents the first time that recommendations are officially made directly from the Betaflight developers to manufacturers. We encourage manufacturers to read this document and offer feedback. "},{"title":"Betaflight 4.4 - 'A New Relationship'​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Approved Partner Program","url":"/partner#betaflight-44---a-new-relationship","content":"Since releasing the Manufacturer Guidelines we have opened new communication channels with selected manufacturers within the application/website Discord. The goal was to discuss issues and engage with the companies, as well as test their hardware in order to verify the quality and performance. As part of the incentive to encourage engagement, we are offering a 'Betaflight Partnership' official certification to manufacturers. They can use this certification to indicate to the userbase that they are supported by Betaflight and our development program. This will be valuable promotion for them to increase purchasing confidence from customers. "},{"title":"Compliance And Project Support​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Approved Partner Program","url":"/partner#compliance-and-project-support","content":"At Betaflight we have a high quality coding team who donate their time and skills free of charge. It is important to retain them in order to progress and maintain the project, and that the work should not demand financial costs in hardware 'as well' as costs in time and effort. Therefore we ask that manufacturers donate hardware necessary in order to support the project. This partnership program is designed to create a 'win-win' scenario for developers and manufacturers. The Betaflight team can help manufacturers make better products and officially recommend them to the userbase, and manufacturers can support the developers with the necessary hardware. The userbase will then benefit from great hardware, and the future of the project will be secure.  The 'Betaflight partner' manufacturers for release 4.4 are Aikon Electronics BetaFPV DJI Foxeer HDZero Radiomaster Skystars RC T-Motor Zeez RC Walksnail  We thank them for their engagement with the program, and their work creating quality hardware for running Betaflight. We will promote these brands as part of the 4.4 release to our userbase.

Think about what you're naming and name it well. Don't be afraid to rename anything.Avoid comments that describe what the code is doing, the code should describe itself. Comments are useful however for big-picture purposes and to document content of variables.If you need to document a variable do it at the declaration, don't copy the comment to the extern usage since it will lead to comment rot.Seek advice from other developers - know you can always learn more.Be professional - attempts at humor or slating existing code in the codebase itself is not helpful when you have to change/fix it.Know that there's always more than one way to do something and that code is never final - but it does have to work.

If you want to make changes and want to make sure it's tested then focus on the minimal set of changes required to add a test. Tests currently live in the test folder and they use the google test framework. The tests are compiled and run natively on your development machine and not on the target platform. This allows you to develop tests and code and actually execute it to make sure it works without needing a development board or simulator. This project could really do with some functional tests which test the behaviour of the application. All pull requests to add/improve the testability of the code or testing methods are highly sought! Note: Tests are written in C++ and linked with with firmware's C code. All code is also instrumented using gcov to make test coverage analysis possible.

It will stop after first compile/build error. If you want it to continue with the next test module you can use make -k test. After they have been executed by the make invocation, you can still run them on the command line to execute the tests and to see the test report. Test reports will also be produced in form of junit XML files, if tests are built and run with the &quot;junittest&quot; goal. Junit report files are saved in obj/test directory and has the following naming pattern test_name_results.xml, for example: obj/test/battery_unittest_results.xml You can also step-debug the tests in eclipse and you can use the GoogleTest test runner to make building and re-running the tests simple.

The primary thing to remember is that separate pull requests should be created for separate branches. Never create a pull request from your master branch. Once you have created the PR, every new commit/push in your branch will propagate from your fork into the PR in the main github/betaflight repo. Checkout another branch first if you want something else. Push will often fail if you edit or squash commits in a branch already pushed. Never do such things after creating the PR. Later, you can get the changes from the betaflight repo into your master branch by adding betaflight as a git remote and merging from it as follows: git remote add betaflight https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight.gitgit checkout mastergit fetch betaflightgit merge betaflight/mastergit push origin master is an optional step that will update your fork on github You can also perform the git commands using the git client inside Eclipse.

Surprisingly this has always been there in the form of the EXTRA_FLAGS command line parameter for make. The cloud building platform merely makes use of this parameter - extensively. The best way to demonstrate this is to give an example: make TARGET=STM32F411 EXTRA_FLAGS=&quot;-DUSE_GPS -DUSE_LED_STRIP&quot;  The above would make a F411 target hex with GPS and LED_STRIP included. Happy compiling! :). For the most part simply make with the MCU target will include almost everytihing. The exception is the lower flash MCUs, e.g. F411 and F722. These do not have the flash space for everything, so even building locally you will need to specify what you would like included. note Please note the use of -D and the USE_. This differs from the way in which the configurator displays theses options. These defines that we add, either on the command line or in the custom defines (in expert mode) in the configurator, are called gates, and include or exclude whole sections of code. If you want to locally compile the default compile time configuration for a given manufacturer you can do so by: make CONFIG=BETAFLIGHTF7  This will build you a target hex file that has everything baked in for that manufacturers configuration, including any default features as specified by the manufacturer.

Therefore the bus...Start() routines should be used which use interrupts to handle the transfer in the background.

It is necessary to register a device as being on an I2C bus in order that it can be accessed. bool i2cBusSetInstance(const extDevice_t *dev, uint32_t device);  This registers the external device dev with an I2C bus device instance device. void i2cBusDeviceRegister(const extDevice_t *dev);  A call to i2cBusDeviceRegister simply increments a count of the number of I2C devices in use. "},{"title":"SPI Specific Access​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Bus and External Device Drivers","url":"/docs/development/API/BusDrivers#spi-specific-access","content":"SPI attached devices are accessed at higher speed and therefore may be accessed using blocking read/writes, however longer transfers or accesses requiring multiple transfers are better performed using DMA transfers under interrupt control. There are a number of SPI specific bus access routines to facilitate such optimisation. As with I2C it is possible to have multiple devices share a common SPI bus. It is necessary to register a device as being on an SPI bus in order that it can be accessed. bool spiSetBusInstance(extDevice_t *dev, uint32_t device);  This registers the external device dev with an SPI bus device instance device. void spiSetClkDivisor(const extDevice_t *dev, uint16_t divider);  Each device on an SPI bus can use a different SPI bus clock speed and this sets the clock divisor to be used for accesses by the given device. Two utility routines are provided to determine the divider value to use in order to achieve a max SPI clock speed, and to return the actual clock speed corresponding to that divisor. // Determine the divisor to use for a given bus frequency uint16_t spiCalculateDivider(uint32_t freq); // Return the SPI clock based on the given divisor uint32_t spiCalculateClock(uint16_t spiClkDivisor);  Access to SPI devices requires that the clock phase/polarity be set appropriately. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface. void spiSetClkPhasePolarity(const extDevice_t *dev, bool leadingEdge);  If leadingEdge is set to true, the default, then data will be clocked on the first rising edge of the clock, or if false, on the second falling edge. void spiDmaEnable(const extDevice_t *dev, bool enable);  Certain devices, such as the CC2500 cannot handle the timing of sequential accesses which are being DMAed, so this enables DMA to be enabled (default) or disabled on a per device basis. In order to support efficient use of SPI it is possible to perform not only single accesses as described above, but also to define a sequence of transfers using an array of busSegment_t elements which then comprise a complete transaction. These may be complex, support polling bus status for example before performing a write. Each busSegment_t element passes a union of either a pair of buffer pointers for write/read respectively, a null link structure used to terminate the list. Following is the number of bytes in the transfer, a boolean, negateCS, indicating if the SPI CS line should be negated at the end of the segment, and an optional callback routine. A good example of this is in m25p16_readBytes() where a segment list is defined thus:  busSegment_t segments[] = { {.u.buffers = {readStatus, readyStatus}, sizeof(readStatus), true, m25p16_callbackReady}, {.u.buffers = {readBytes, NULL}, fdevice-&gt;isLargeFlash ? 5 : 4, false, NULL}, {.u.buffers = {NULL, buffer}, length, true, NULL}, {.u.link = {NULL, NULL}, 0, true, NULL}, };  In the above example the busy status of the FLASH memory is polled in the first element and then m25p16_callbackReady() is called which checks the read status. If the device is busy the value BUS_BUSY is returned and the element will be repeated under interrupt/DMA control. If the device is ready to accept a new command then BUS_READY is returned and the next element is processed. BUS_ABORT may also be returned in abort the whole transaction, although this is not currently used. It can be faster to perform short transfers using polled access rather than setting up DMAs and the rules are as follows to determine if DMA should be use. DMA is enabled on the bus and deviceAll transmit/receive buffers are in memory supporting DMAsOne of the following: There are are at least SPI_DMA_THRESHOLD bytes to transferThere is more than a single element in the segment listThe negateCS boolean is set to false in the terminating entry of the list. The ELRS driver in rx_sx1280.c is an example of 3.3 where the terminating link has negateCS set to false. This then ensures that all accesses run in the background without blocking. void spiSequence(const extDevice_t *dev, busSegment_t *segments);  This routine queues the given segment list for processing. If the device's bus is already busy then this segment list will be linked to the preceeding one in the queue so that the accesses will automatically proceed one after the other as quickly as possible. void spiWait(const extDevice_t *dev);  Block, waiting for completion of the indicated device's bus activity. bool spiIsBusy(const extDevice_t *dev);  Return true if the device's bus is busy.

I relies on gcc cleanup function (attribute ((cleanup))) and assumes that cleanup handler is called, when leaving block, even when associated variable is eliminated. There is (a bit paranoid) safeguard warning to make sure that generated assembly is hand-checked on new gcc version. It is assumed that only major gcc version versions need to be checked. If GCC is upgraded and a warning appears when compiling then the generated asm source must be verified. e.g. %% serial_softserial.c warning &quot;Please verify that ATOMIC_BARRIER works as intended&quot; To perform the verification, proceed as per discusson on issue #167 which reads: I hope it's enough to check that optimized-away variable still has cleanup code at end of scope. static int markme=0; markme++; ATOMIC_BLOCK_NB(0xff) { ATOMIC_BARRIER(markme); markme++; }; markme++; pass -save-temps=obj (or -save-temps=cwd, but lots of files will end up in same directory as makefile) to gcc link step (LTO is in use), find resulting *.ltrans*.ltrans.s (grep for markme, on linux it ends up in /tmp) and check that generated assembly sequence is: MSR basepri_max, r3 # (possibly markme address load) # barier (markme) start # (increment markme, load and store to memory) ldr r2, [r3] adds r0, r2, #1 str r0, [r3] # barier(markme) end MSR basepri, r3 # (markme value should be cached in register on next increment) The # barrier(markme) must surround access code and must be inside MSR basepri instructions . Similar approach is used for ATOMIC_BLOCK in avr libraries, so gcc should not break this behavior. IMO attribute(cleanup) and asm volatile is defined in a way that should guarantee this. attribute(cleanup) is probably safer way to implement atomic sections - another possibility is to explicitly place barriers in code, but that can (and will eventually) lead to missed barrier/basepri restore on same path creating very hard to find bug. The 'MEMORY_BARRIER()' code can be omitted when 'ATOMIC_BLOCK' (with full memory barriers) is used, but it is better to explicitly state what memory is protected by barrier. gcc 5 can use this knowledge to greatly improve generated code.","keywords":""},{"title":"MSP Extensions","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/development/API/MSP-Extensions","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Mode Ranges​","type":1,"pageTitle":"MSP Extensions","url":"/docs/development/API/MSP-Extensions#mode-ranges","content":""},{"title":"MSP_MODE_RANGES​","type":1,"pageTitle":"MSP Extensions","url":"/docs/development/API/MSP-Extensions#msp_mode_ranges","content":"The MSP_MODE_RANGES returns the current auxiliary mode settings from the flight controller.

"},{"title":"ADC Sensor​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Battery Monitoring","url":"/docs/development/Battery#adc-sensor","content":"The current meter needs to be configured so the value read at the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) input matches actual current draw. Just like you need a voltmeter to correctly calibrate your voltage reading you also need an ammeter to calibrate the current sensor. Unlike voltage sensing which is usually quite good from the factory, current sensing varies significantly from board to board and should be calibrated. It is recommended to set multiwii_amperage_meter_output to OFF when calibrating ADC current sensor. To measure the current a linear response device is used that converts the current traveling through it to a voltage to be read by the ADC on your flight controller. The maximum voltage that the flight controller can read is 3.3V (3300 mV), this is usually the limiting factor on the maximum measurable current. Most sensors use a shunt resistor to measure current however there are a few that use hall effect sensors. The flight controller uses the following equation to convert the measured ADC voltage to a current. Current(Amps) = ADC (mV) / amperage_meter_scale * 10 + amperage_meter_offset / 1000  Where the calibrations are: Setting\tDescriptionamperage_meter_scale\tThe scaling factor in mV/10A amperage_meter_offset\tThe offset in mA This is in the mathematical form of y = x/m + b and with a few measurements along this line you can calibrate any combination of sensor and flight controller to a high accuracy. Calibrate using an ammeter​ !!Important: Always take off your props before doing any testing!! To calibrate your flight controller with a current meter follow these steps. Make a copy of this google sheet. It will do all the math for you.Hook your ammeter up in series with your drone and a charged battery. I suggest an XT60 extender with one lead cut. Now your ammeter will be displaying the true current draw of your system.Connect to your flight controller through the configurator and check your current calibrations. Change them in the google sheet if needed.Use the motor tab to increase the throttle and change the current draw of the drone to around 1 A on the ammeter (it does not matter if it is not exact).Switch back to the power and battery tab and record current from the ammeter in the measured current column and the current reported by Betaflight in the flight controller current column (both in amps, to 2 decimal places).Repeat this measurement (steps 4 and 5) 3 or more times at various currents from 0 to 5 Amps (make sure not to go over your ammeter rated current).Once this is done make sure the results are linear on the graph and that the regression value is green. You can now update to the new calibration values and enjoy accurate battery usage information. The same method can be applied to both hall effect sensors and shunt resistors. Shunt resistors will usually have an offset of less than +/- 1000 mA however hall effect sensors offsets will be much higher. Note that while your calibration may be correct there is still a maximum current measure that you may exceed at maximum throttle, this will cause the current recorded by the flight controller to ceiling at this value even if the actual current is higher. As a result the reported mAh used may be less than is actually used, always keep an eye on the battery voltage as well. If you do not want to use google sheets then simply use some other tool that preforms a linear regression on the dataset. Multiply amperage_meter_scale used in testing by the slope and subtract the intercept in mA from amperage_meter_offset to get the corrected calibration values. "},{"title":"Virtual Sensor​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Battery Monitoring","url":"/docs/development/Battery#virtual-sensor","content":"The virtual sensor uses the throttle position to calculate an estimated current value. This is useful when a real sensor is not available. The following settings adjust the virtual sensor calibration: Setting\tDescriptionamperage_meter_scale\tThe throttle scaling factor [centiamps, i.e. 1/100th A] amperage_meter_offset\tThe current at zero throttle (while disarmed) [centiamps, i.e. 1/100th A] There are two simple methods to tune these parameters: one uses a battery charger and another depends on actual current measurements. Tuning Using Actual Current Measurements​ If you know your craft's current draw (in Amperes) while disarmed (Imin) and at maximum throttle while armed (Imax), calculate the scaling factors as follows: amperage_meter_scale = (Imax - Imin) * 100000 / (Tmax + (Tmax * Tmax / 50)) amperage_meter_offset = Imin * 100  Note: Tmax is maximum throttle offset (i.e. for max_throttle = 1850, Tmax = 1850 - 1000 = 850) For example, assuming a maximum current of 34.2A, a minimum current of 2.8A, and a Tmax max_throttle = 1850: amperage_meter_scale = (Imax - Imin) * 100000 / (Tmax + (Tmax * Tmax / 50)) = (34.2 - 2.8) * 100000 / (850 + (850 * 850 / 50)) = 205 amperage_meter_offset = Imin * 100 = 280  Measuring Imax requires a battery and an ESC that can both deliver and support max current for the duration of the measurement, so it's prone to big inaccuracies. Alternatively, current can be measured at a much lower throttle position and be taken into account in the calculations. Following the previous example, if we measured an Ibench current of 6A at 30% of throttle (1255 in the motors tab because (0.3*(max_throttle-1000))+1000)) Tbench = Tmax * bench_throttle = 850 * 0.3 = 255 amperage_meter_scale = (Ibench - Imin) * 100000 / (Tbench + (Tbench * Tbench / 50)) = (6 - 2.8) * 100000 / (255 + (255 * 255 / 50)) = 205 amperage_meter_offset = Imin * 100 = 280  Tuning Using Battery Charger Measurement​ If you cannot measure current draw directly, you can approximate it indirectly using your battery charger. However, note it may be difficult to adjust amperage_meter_offset using this method unless you can measure the actual current draw with the craft disarmed.

"},{"title":"Supported configurations​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Blackbox flight data recorder","url":"/docs/development/Blackbox#supported-configurations","content":"The maximum data rate that can be recorded to the flight log is fairly restricted, so anything that increases the load can cause the flight log to drop frames and contain errors. The Blackbox is typically used on tricopters and quadcopters. Although it will work on hexacopters and octocopters, because these craft have more motors to record, they must transmit more data to the flight log. This can increase the number of dropped frames. Although the browser-based log viewer supports hexacopters and octocopters, the command-lineblackbox_render tool currently only supports tri- and quadcopters. Cleanflight's looptime setting decides how frequently an update is saved to the flight log. The default looptime on Cleanflight is 3500. If you're using a looptime smaller than about 2400, you may experience some dropped frames due to the high required data rate. In that case you will need to reduce the sampling rate in the Blackbox settings, or increase your logger's baudrate to 250000. See the later section on configuring the Blackbox feature for details.

"},{"title":"OpenLog serial data logger​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Blackbox flight data recorder","url":"/docs/development/Blackbox#openlog-serial-data-logger","content":"The OpenLog is a small logging device which attaches to your flight controller using a serial port and logs your flights to a MicroSD card. The OpenLog ships from SparkFun with standard &quot;OpenLog 3&quot; firmware installed. Although this original OpenLog firmware will work with the Blackbox, in order to reduce the number of dropped frames it should be reflashed with the higher performance OpenLog Blackbox firmware. The special Blackbox variant of the OpenLog firmware also ensures that the OpenLog is using Cleanflight compatible settings, and defaults to 115200 baud. You can find the Blackbox version of the OpenLog firmware here, along with instructions for installing it onto your OpenLog. microSDHC​ Your choice of microSDHC card is very important to the performance of the system. The OpenLog relies on being able to make many small writes to the card with minimal delay, which not every card is good at. A faster SD-card speed rating is not a guarantee of better performance. microSDHC cards known to have poor performance​ Generic 4GB Class 4 microSDHC card - the rate of missing frames is about 1%, and is concentrated around the most interesting parts of the log!Sandisk Ultra 32GB (unlike the smaller 16GB version, this version has poor write latency) microSDHC cards known to have good performance​ Transcend 16GB Class 10 UHS-I microSDHC (typical error rate &lt; 0.1%)Sandisk Extreme 16GB Class 10 UHS-I microSDHC (typical error rate &lt; 0.1%)Sandisk Ultra 16GB (it performs only half as well as the Extreme in theory, but still very good) You should format any card you use with the SD Association's special formatting tool , as it will give the OpenLog the best chance of writing at high speed. You must format it with either FAT, or with FAT32 (recommended). "},{"title":"Choosing a serial port for the OpenLog​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Blackbox flight data recorder","url":"/docs/development/Blackbox#choosing-a-serial-port-for-the-openlog","content":"First, tell the Blackbox to log using a serial port (rather than to an onboard dataflash chip). Go to the Configurator's CLI tab, enter set blackbox_device=SERIAL to switch logging to serial, and save. You need to let Cleanflight know which of your serial ports you connect your OpenLog to (i.e. the Blackbox port), which you can do on the Configurator's Ports tab. You should use a hardware serial port (such as UART1 on the Naze32, the two-pin Tx/Rx header in the center of the board). SoftSerial ports can be used for the Blackbox. However, because they are limited to 19200 baud, your logging rate will need to be severely reduced to compensate. Therefore the use of SoftSerial is not recommended. When using a hardware serial port, Blackbox should be set to at least 115200 baud on that port. When using fast looptimes (&lt;2500), a baud rate of 250000 should be used instead in order to reduce dropped frames. The serial port used for Blackbox cannot be shared with any other function (e.g. GPS, telemetry) except the MSP protocol. If MSP is used on the same port as Blackbox, then MSP will be active when the board is disarmed, and Blackbox will be active when the board is armed. This will mean that you can't use the Configurator or any other function that requires MSP, such as an OSD or a Bluetooth wireless configuration app, while the board is armed. Connect the &quot;TX&quot; pin of the serial port you've chosen to the OpenLog's &quot;RXI&quot; pin. Don't connect the serial port's RX pin to the OpenLog, as this will cause the OpenLog to interfere with any shared functions on the serial port while disarmed. Naze32 serial port choices​ On the Naze32, the TX/RX pins on top of the board are connected to UART1, and are shared with the USB connector. Therefore, MSP must be enabled on UART1 in order to use the Configurator over USB. If Blackbox is connected to the pins on top of the Naze32, the Configurator will stop working once the board is armed. This configuration is usually a good choice if you don't already have an OSD installed which is using those pins while armed, and aren't using the FrSky telemetry pins. Pin RC3 on the side of the board is UART2's Tx pin. If Blackbox is configured on UART2, MSP can still be used on UART1 when the board is armed, which means that the Configurator will continue to work simultaneously with Blackbox logging. Note that in PARALLEL_PWM mode this leaves the board with 6 input channels as RC3 and RC4 pins are used by UART2 as Tx and Rx. Cleanflight automatically shifts logical channel mapping for you when UART2 is enabled in Ports tab so you'll have to shift receiver pins that are connected to Naze32 pins 3 to 6 by two. The OpenLog tolerates a power supply of between 3.3V and 12V. If you are powering your Naze32 with a standard 5V BEC, then you can use a spare motor header's +5V and GND pins to power the OpenLog with. Other flight controller hardware​ Boards other than the Naze32 may have more accessible hardware serial devices, in which case refer to their documentation to decide how to wire up the logger. The key criteria are: Should be a hardware serial port rather than SoftSerial.Cannot be shared with any other function (GPS, telemetry) except MSP.If MSP is used on the same UART, MSP will stop working when the board is armed. OpenLog configuration​ Power up the OpenLog with a microSD card inside, wait 10 seconds or so, then power it down and plug the microSD card into your computer. You should find a &quot;CONFIG.TXT&quot; file on the card, open it up in a text editor. You should see the baud rate that the OpenLog has been configured for (usually 115200 or 9600 from the factory). Set the baud rate to match the rate you entered for the Blackbox in the Configurator's Port tab (typically 115200 or 250000). Save the file and put the card back into your OpenLog, it will use those settings from now on. If your OpenLog didn't write a CONFIG.TXT file, create a CONFIG.TXT file with these contents and store it in the root of the MicroSD card: 115200 baud  If you are using the original OpenLog firmware, use this configuration instead: 115200,26,0,0,1,0,1 baud,escape,esc#,mode,verb,echo,ignoreRX  OpenLog protection​ The OpenLog can be wrapped in black electrical tape or heat-shrink in order to insulate it from conductive frames (like carbon fiber), but this makes its status LEDs impossible to see. I recommend wrapping it with some clear heatshrink tubing instead.

This allows for very high speed logging (1KHz or faster, which is a looptime of 1000 or lower) on suitable cards. The card can be either Standard (SDSC) or High capacity (SDHC), and must be formatted with the FAT16 or FAT32 filesystems. This covers a range of card capacities from 1 to 32GB. Extended capacity cards (SDXC) are not supported. The first time you power up Cleanflight with a new card inserted, the flight controller will spend a few seconds scanning the disk for free space and collecting this space together into a file called &quot;FREESPAC.E&quot;. During flight, Cleanflight will carve chunks from this file to create new log files. You must not edit this file on your computer (i.e. open it in a program and save changes) because this may cause it to become fragmented. Don't run any defragmentation tools on the card either. You can delete the FREESPAC.E file if you want to free up space on the card to fit non-Blackbox files (Cleanflight will recreate the FREESPAC.E file next time it starts, using whatever free space was left over). The maximum size of the FREESPAC.E file is currently 4GB. Once 4GB worth of logs have been recorded, the FREESPAC.E file will be nearly empty and no more logs will be able to be recorded. At this point you should either delete the FREESPAC.E file (and any logs left on the card to free up space), or just reformat the card. A new FREESPAC.E file will be created by Cleanflight on its next boot.

"},{"title":"Configuring the Blackbox​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Blackbox flight data recorder","url":"/docs/development/Blackbox#configuring-the-blackbox","content":"The Blackbox currently provides two settings (blackbox_rate_num and blackbox_rate_denom) that allow you to control the rate at which data is logged. These two together form a fraction (blackbox_rate_num / blackbox_rate_denom) which decides what portion of the flight controller's control loop iterations should be logged. The default is 1/1 which logs every iteration. If you're using a slower MicroSD card, you may need to reduce your logging rate to reduce the number of corrupted logged frames that blackbox_decode complains about. A rate of 1/2 is likely to work for most craft. You can change the logging rate settings by entering the CLI tab in the Cleanflight Configurator and using the setcommand, like so: set blackbox_rate_num = 1 set blackbox_rate_denom = 2  The data rate for my quadcopter using a looptime of 2400 and a rate of 1/1 is about 10.25kB/s. This allows about 18 days of flight logs to fit on my OpenLog's 16GB MicroSD card, which ought to be enough for anybody :). If you are logging using SoftSerial, you will almost certainly need to reduce your logging rate to 1/32. Even at that logging rate, looptimes faster than about 1000 cannot be successfully logged. If you're logging to an onboard dataflash chip instead of an OpenLog, be aware that the 2MB of storage space it offers is pretty small. At the default 1/1 logging rate, and a 2400 looptime, this is only enough for about 3 minutes of flight. This could be long enough for you to investigate some flying problem with your craft, but you may want to reduce the logging rate in order to extend your recording time. To maximize your recording time, you could drop the rate all the way down to 1/32 (the smallest possible rate) which would result in a logging rate of about 10-20Hz and about 650 bytes/second of data. At that logging rate, a 2MB dataflash chip can store around 50 minutes of flight data, though the level of detail is severely reduced and you could not diagnose flight problems like vibration or PID setting issues.

The data will include algorithm inputs such as sensor and RC data, intermediate results from flight control algorithms, and algorithm outputs such as motor commands.

These record the primary state of the flight controller (RC input, gyroscopes, flight control algorithm intermediates, motor outputs), and are logged during every logging iteration. Each main frame must contain at least two fields, &quot;loopIteration&quot; which records the index of the current main loop iteration (starting at zero for the first logged iteration), and &quot;time&quot; which records the timestamp of the beginning of the main loop in microseconds (this needn't start at zero, on Cleanflight it represents the system uptime). There are two kinds of main frames, &quot;I&quot; and &quot;P&quot;. &quot;I&quot;, or &quot;intra&quot; frames are like video keyframes. They can be decoded without reference to any previous frame, so they allow log decoding to be resynchronized in the event of log damage. &quot;P&quot; or &quot;inter&quot; frames use an encoding which references previously logged frames in order to reduce the required datarate. When one interframe fails to decode, all following interframes will be undecodable up until the next intraframe. "},{"title":"GPS frames: G, H​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Blackbox logging internals","url":"/docs/development/Blackbox-Internals#gps-frames-g-h","content":"Because the GPS is updated so infrequently, GPS data is logged in its own dedicated frames. These are recorded whenever the GPS data changes (not necessarily alongside every main frame). Like the main frames, the GPS frames have their own intra/inter encoding system. The &quot;H&quot; or &quot;home&quot; frame records the lat/lon of a reference point. The &quot;G&quot; or &quot;GPS&quot; frame records the current state of the GPS system (current position, altitude etc.) based on the reference point. The reference point can be updated (infrequently) during the flight, and is logged whenever it changes. To allow &quot;G&quot; frames to continue be decoded in the event that an &quot;H&quot; update is dropped from the log, the &quot;H&quot; frame is logged periodically even if it has not changed (say, every 10 seconds). This caps the duration of unreadble &quot;G&quot; frames that will result from a single missed &quot;H&quot; change.

Logging the fact that this data had not been updated during every single logging iteration would be a waste of bandwidth, so these frames are only logged when the &quot;slow&quot; state actually changes. All Slow frames are logged as intraframes. An interframe encoding scheme can't be used for Slow frames, because one damaged frame causes all subsequent interframes to be undecodable. Because Slow frames are written so infrequently, one missing Slow frame could invalidate minutes worth of Slow state. On Cleanflight, Slow frames are currently used to log data like the user-chosen flight mode and the current failsafe state. "},{"title":"Event frames: E​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Blackbox logging internals","url":"/docs/development/Blackbox-Internals#event-frames-e","content":"Some flight controller data is updated so infrequently or exists so transiently that we do not log it as a flight controller &quot;state&quot;. Instead, we log it as a state transition . This data is logged in &quot;E&quot; or &quot;event&quot; frames. Each event frame payload begins with a single byte &quot;event type&quot; field. The format of the rest of the payload is not encoded in the flight log, so its interpretation is left up to an agreement of the writer and the decoder. For example, one event that Cleanflight logs is that the user has adjusted a system setting (such as a PID setting) using Cleanflight's inflight adjustments feature. The event payload notes which setting was adjusted and the new value for the setting. Because these setting updates are so rare, it would be wasteful to treat the settings as &quot;state&quot; and log the fact that the setting had not been changed during every logging iteration. It would be infeasible to periodically log the system settings using an intra/interframe scheme, because the intraframes would be so large. Instead we only log the transitions as events, accept the small probability that any one of those events will be damaged/absent in the log, and leave it up to log readers to decide the extent to which they are willing to assume that the state of the setting between successfully-decoded transition events was truly unchanged. "},{"title":"Log field format​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Blackbox logging internals","url":"/docs/development/Blackbox-Internals#log-field-format","content":"For every field in a given frame type, there is an associated name, predictor, and encoding. When a field is written, the chosen predictor is computed for the field, then this predictor value is subtracted from the raw field value. Finally, the encoder is used to transform the value into bytes to be written to the logging device. "},{"title":"Field predictors​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Blackbox logging internals","url":"/docs/development/Blackbox-Internals#field-predictors","content":"The job of the predictor is to bring the value to be encoded as close to zero as possible. The predictor may be based on the values seen for the field in a previous frame, or some other value such as a fixed value or a value recorded in the log headers. For example, the battery voltage values in &quot;I&quot; intraframes in Cleanflight use a reference voltage that is logged as part of the headers as a predictor. This assumes that battery voltages will be broadly similar to the initial pack voltage of the flight (e.g. 4S battery voltages are likely to lie within a small range for the whole flight). In &quot;P&quot; interframes, the battery voltage will instead use the previously-logged voltage as a predictor, because the correlation between successive voltage readings is high. These predictors are presently available: Predict zero (0)​ This predictor is the null-predictor which doesn't modify the field value at all. It is a common choice for fields which are already close to zero, or where no better history is available (e.g. in intraframes which may not rely on the previous value of fields). Predict last value (1)​ This is the most common predictor in interframes. The last-logged value of the field will be used as the predictor, and subtracted from the raw field value. For fields which don't change very often, this will make their encoded value be normally zero. Most fields have some time-correlation, so this predictor should reduce the magnitude of all but the noisiest fields. Predict straight line (2)​ This predictor assumes that the slope between the current measurement and the previous one will be similar to the slope between the previous measurement and the one before that. This is common for fields which increase at a steady rate, such as the &quot;time&quot; field. The predictor is history_age_2 - 2 * history_age_1. Predict average 2 (3)​ This predictor is the average of the two previously logged values of the field (i.e. (history_age_1 + history_age_2) / 2). It is used when there is significant random noise involved in the field, which means that the average of the recent history is a better predictor of the next value than the previous value on its own would be (for example, in gyroscope or motor measurements). Predict minthrottle (4)​ This predictor subtracts the value of &quot;minthrottle&quot; which is included in the log header. In Cleanflight, motors always lie in the range of [minthrottle ... maxthrottle] when the craft is armed, so this predictor is used for the first motor value in intraframes. Predict motor[0] (5)​ This predictor is set to the value of motor[0] which was decoded earlier within the current frame. It is used in intraframes for every motor after the first one, because the motor commands typically lie in a tight grouping. Predict increment (6)​ This predictor assumes that the field will be incremented by 1 unit for every main loop iteration. This is used to predict the loopIteration field, which increases by 1 for every loop iteration. Predict home-coord (7)​ This predictor is set to the corresponding latitude or longitude field from the GPS home coordinate (which was logged in a preceding &quot;H&quot; frame). If no preceding &quot;H&quot; frame exists, the value is marked as invalid. Predict 1500 (8)​ This predictor is set to a fixed value of 1500. It is preferred for logging servo values in intraframes, since these typically lie close to the midpoint of 1500us. Predict vbatref (9)​ This predictor is set to the &quot;vbatref&quot; field written in the log header. It is used when logging intraframe battery voltages in Cleanflight, since these are expected to be broadly similar to the first battery voltage seen during arming. Predict last main-frame time (10)​ This predictor is set to the last logged time field from the main frame. This is used when predicting timestamps of non-main frames (e.g. that might be logging the timing of an event that happened during the main loop cycle, like a GPS reading). "},{"title":"Field encoders​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Blackbox logging internals","url":"/docs/development/Blackbox-Internals#field-encoders","content":"The field encoder's job is to use fewer bits to represent values which are closer to zero than for values that are further from zero. Blackbox supports a range of different encoders, which should be chosen on a per-field basis in order to minimize the encoded data size. The choice of best encoder is based on the probability distribution of the values which are to be encoded. For example, if a field is almost always zero, then an encoding should be chosen for it which can encode that case into a very small number of bits, such as one. Conversely, if a field is normally 8-16 bits large, it would be wasteful to use an encoder which provided a special short encoded representation for zero values, because this will increase the encoded length of larger values. These encoders are presently available: Unsigned variable byte (1)​ This is the most straightforward encoding. This encoding uses the lower 7 bits of an encoded byte to store the lower 7 bits of the field's value. The high bit of that encoded byte is set to one if more than 7 bits are required to store the value. If the value did exceed 7 bits, the lower 7 bits of the value (which were written to the log) are removed from the value (by right shift), and the encoding process begins again with the new value. This can be represented by the following algorithm: while (value &gt; 127) { writeByte((uint8_t) (value | 0x80)); // Set the high bit to mean &quot;more bytes follow&quot; value &gt;&gt;= 7; } writeByte(value);  Here are some example values encoded using variable-byte encoding: Input value\tOutput encoding1\t0x01 42\t0x2A 127\t0x7F 128\t0x80 0x01 129\t0x81 0x01 23456\t0xA0 0xB7 0x01 Signed variable byte (0)​ This encoding applies a pre-processing step to fold negative values into positive ones, then the resulting unsigned number is encoded using unsigned variable byte encoding. The folding is accomplished by &quot;ZigZag&quot; encoding, which is represented by: unsigned32 = (signed32 &lt;&lt; 1) ^ (signed32 &gt;&gt; 31)  ZigZag encoding is preferred against simply casting the signed integer to unsigned, because casting would cause small negative quantities to appear to be very large unsigned integers, causing the encoded length to be similarly large. ZigZag encoding ensures that values near zero are still near zero after encoding. Here are some example integers encoded using ZigZag encoding: Input value\tZigZag encoding0\t0 -1\t1 1\t2 -2\t3 2147483647\t4294967294 -2147483648\t4294967295 Neg 14-bit (3)​ The value is negated, treated as an unsigned 14 bit integer, then encoded using unsigned variable byte encoding. This bizarre encoding is used in Cleanflight for battery pack voltages. This is because battery voltages are measured using a 14-bit ADC, with a predictor which is set to the battery voltage during arming, which is expected to be higher than any voltage experienced during flight. After the predictor is subtracted, the battery voltage will almost certainly be below zero. This results in small encoded values when the voltage is closely below the initial one, at the expense of very large encoded values if the voltage rises higher than the initial one. Elias delta unsigned 32-bit (4)​ Because this encoding produces a bitstream, this is the only encoding for which the encoded value might not be a whole number of bytes. If the bitstream isn't aligned on a byte boundary by the time the next non-Elias Delta field arrives, or the end of the frame is reached, the final byte is padded with zeros byte-align the stream. This encoding requires more CPU time than the other encodings because of the bit juggling involved in writing the bitstream. When this encoder is chosen to encode all of the values in Cleanflight interframes, it saves about 10% bandwidth compared to using a mixture of the other encodings, but uses too much CPU time to be practical. The basic encoding algorithm is defined on Wikipedia. Given these utility functions: /* Write `bitCount` bits from the least-significant end of the `bits` integer to the bitstream. The most-significant bit * will be written first */ void writeBits(uint32_t bits, unsigned int bitCount); /* Returns the number of bits needed to hold the top-most 1-bit of the integer 'i'. 'i' must not be zero. */ unsigned int numBitsToStoreInteger(uint32_t i);  This is our reference implementation of Elias Delta: // Value must be more than zero void writeU32EliasDeltaInternal(uint32_t value) { unsigned int valueLen, lengthOfValueLen; valueLen = numBitsToStoreInteger(value); lengthOfValueLen = numBitsToStoreInteger(valueLen); // Use unary to encode the number of bits we'll need to write the length of the value writeBits(0, lengthOfValueLen - 1); // Now write the length of the value writeBits(valueLen, lengthOfValueLen); // Having now encoded the position of the top bit of value, write its remaining bits writeBits(value, valueLen - 1); }  To this we add a wrapper which allows encoding both the value zero and MAXINT: void writeU32EliasDelta(uint32_t value) { /* We can't encode value==0, so we need to add 1 to the value before encoding * * That would make it impossible to encode MAXINT, so use 0xFFFFFFFF as an escape * code with an additional bit to choose between MAXINT-1 or MAXINT. */ if (value &gt;= 0xFFFFFFFE) { // Write the escape code writeU32EliasDeltaInternal(0xFFFFFFFF); // Add a one bit after the escape code if we wanted &quot;MAXINT&quot;, or a zero if we wanted &quot;MAXINT - 1&quot; writeBits(value - 0xFFFFFFFE, 1); } else { writeU32EliasDeltaInternal(value + 1); } }  Here are some reference encoded bit patterns produced by writeU32EliasDelta: Input value\tEncoded bit string0\t1 1\t0100 2\t0101 3\t01100 4\t01101 5\t01110 6\t01111 7\t00100000 8\t00100001 9\t00100010 10\t00100011 11\t00100100 12\t00100101 13\t00100110 14\t00100111 15\t001010000 225\t00010001100010 4294967292\t000001000001111111111111111111111111111101 4294967293\t000001000001111111111111111111111111111110 4294967294\t0000010000011111111111111111111111111111110 4294967295\t0000010000011111111111111111111111111111111 Note that the very common value of zero encodes to a single bit, medium-sized values like 225 encode to 14 bits (an overhead of 4 bits over writing a plain 8 bit value), and typical 32-bit values like 4294967293 encode into 42 bits, an overhead of 10 bits. Elias delta signed 32-bit (5)​ The value is first converted to unsigned using ZigZag encoding, then unsigned Elias-delta encoding is applied. TAG8_8SVB (6)​ First, an 8-bit (one byte) header is written. This header has its bits set to zero when the corresponding field (from a maximum of 8 fields) is set to zero, otherwise the bit is set to one. The least-signficant bit in the header corresponds to the first field to be written. This header is followed by the values of only the fields which are non-zero, written using signed variable byte encoding. This encoding is preferred for groups of fields in interframes which are infrequently updated by the flight controller. This will mean that their predictions are usually perfect, and so the value to be encoded for each field will normally be zero. This is common for values like RC inputs and barometer readings, which are updated in only a fraction of main loop iterations. For example, given these field values to encode: 0, 0, 4, 0, 8  This would be encoded: 0b00010100, 0x04, 0x08  TAG2_3S32 (7)​ A 2-bit header is written, followed by 3 signed field values of up to 32 bits each. The header value is based on the maximum size in bits of the three values to be encoded as follows: Header value\tMaximum field value size\tField range0\t2 bits\t[-2...1] 1\t4 bits\t[-8...7] 2\t6 bits\t[-32...31] 3\tUp to 32 bits\t[-2147483648...2147483647] If any of the three values requires more than 6 bits to encode, a second, 6-bit header value is written in the lower bits of the initial header byte. This second header has 2 bits for each of the encoded values which represents how many bytes are required to encode that value. The least-significant bits of the header represent the first field which is encoded. The values for each possibility are as follows: Header value\tField size\tField range0\t1 byte\t[-127...128] 1\t2 bytes\t[-32768...32767] 2\t3 bytes\t[-8388608...8388607] 3\t4 bytes\t[-2147483648...2147483647] This header is followed by the actual field values in order, written least-significant byte first, using the byte lengths specified in the header. So bringing it all together, these encoded bit patterns are possible, where &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; mean bits fixed to be those values, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; represent the first, second and third fields, and &quot;s&quot; represents the bits of the secondary header in the case that any field is larger than 6 bits: 00AA BBCC, 0100 AAAA BBBB CCCC 10AA AAAA 00BB BBBB 00CC CCCC 11ss ssss (followed by fields of byte lengths specified in the &quot;s&quot; header)  This encoding is useful for fields like 3-axis gyroscopes, which are frequently small and typically have similar magnitudes. TAG8_4S16 (8)​ An 8-bit header is written, followed by 4 signed field values of up to 16 bits each. The 8-bit header value has 2 bits for each of the encoded fields (the least-significant bits represent the first field) which represent the number of bits required to encode that field as follows: Header value\tField value size\tField range0\t0 bits\t[0...0] 1\t4 bits\t[-8...7] 2\t8 bits\t[-128...127] 3\t16 bits\t[-32768...32767] This header is followed by the actual field values in order, written as if the output stream was a bit-stream, with the most-significant bit of the first field ending up in the most-significant bits of the first written byte. If the number of nibbles written is odd, the final byte has its least-significant nibble set to zero. For example, given these field values: 13, 0, 4, 2  Choosing from the allowable field value sizes, they may be encoded using this many bits each: 8, 0, 4, 4  The corresponding header values for these lengths would be: 2, 0, 1, 1  So the header and fields would be encoded together as: 0b01010010, 0x0D, 0x42  NULL (9)​ This encoding does not write any bytes to the file. It is used when the predictor will always perfectly predict the value of the field, so the remainder is always zero. In practice this is only used for the &quot;loopIteration&quot; field in interframes, which is always perfectly predictable based on the logged frame's position in the sequence of frames and the &quot;P interval&quot; setting from the header.

When a loop iteration is not logged, Blackbox is not called, no state is read from the flight controller, and nothing is written to the log. Two header lines are included to note which main loop iterations will be logged: I interval​ This header notes which of the main loop iterations will record an &quot;I&quot; intraframe to the log. If main loop iterations with indexes divisible by 32 will be logged as &quot;I&quot; frames, the header will be: H I interval: 32  The first main loop iteration seen by Blackbox will be numbered with index 0, so the first main loop iteration will always be logged as an intraframe. P interval​ Not every &quot;P&quot; interframe needs to be logged. Blackbox will log a portion of iterations in order to bring the total portion of logged main frames to a user-chosen fraction. This fraction is called the logging rate. The smallest possible logging rate is (1/I interval) which corresponds to logging only &quot;I&quot; frames at the &quot;I&quot; interval and discarding all other loop iterations. The maximum logging rate is 1/1, where every main loop iteration that is not an &quot;I&quot; frame is logged as a &quot;P&quot; frame. The header records the logging rate fraction in numerator/denominator format like so: H P interval:1/2  The logging fraction given by num/denom should be simplified (i.e. rather than 2/6, a logging rate of 1/3 should be used). Given a logging rate of num/denom and an I-frame interval of I_INTERVAL, the frame type to log for an iteration of index iteration is given by: if (iteration % I_INTERVAL == 0) return 'I'; if ((iteration % I_INTERVAL + num - 1) % denom &lt; num) return 'P'; return '.'; // i.e. don't log this iteration  For an I-interval of 32, these are the resulting logging patterns at some different P logging rates.

In order to convert raw gyroscope, accelerometer and voltage readings into real-world units, the Blackbox decoder requires the calibration constants &quot;gyro.scale&quot;, &quot;acc_1G&quot; and &quot;vbatscale&quot;.

Accordingly, Blackbox logs do not bother to include any checksums (bytes are not expected to be damaged by the logging device without changing the length of the message). Because of the tight bandwidth requirements of logging, neither a frame length field nor frame trailer is recorded that would allow for the detection of missing bytes. Instead, the decoder uses a heuristic in order to detect damaged frames. The decoder reads an entire frame from the log (using the decoder for each field which is the counterpart of the encoder specified in the header), then it checks to see if the byte immediately following the frame, which should be the beginning of a next frame, is a recognized frame-type byte (e.g. 'I', 'P', 'E', etc). If that following byte represents a valid frame type, it is assumed that the decoded frame was the correct length (so was unlikely to have had random ranges of bytes removed from it, which would have likely altered the frame length). Otherwise, the frame is rejected, and a valid frame-type byte is looked for immediately after the frame-start byte of the frame that was rejected. A rejected frame causes all subsequent interframes to be rejected as well, up until the next intraframe. A frame is also rejected if the &quot;loopIteration&quot; or &quot;time&quot; fields have made unreasonable leaps forward, or moved at all backwards. This suffices to detect almost all log corruption. "},{"title":"Installing the Linux subsystem","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/development/Building-Betaflight-on-Windows-the-Linux-subsystem-way","content":"Installing the Linux subsystem Your PC must be running a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Anniversary Update or later (build 1607+). You will need to restart your PC at least once, so be mentally prepared for that. Listening to Kraftwerk is known to increase the success rate of this process. First, install the Linux subsystem from this great guide (from which I stole the first sentence): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10 Note for absolute newbs regarding Ubuntu (maybe applies to others, but IDK), when prompted to enter a new UNIX user, be sure to use only lower case. The user name is compared to a regular expression that only allows lower case, but not upper. It should look like this: If you don't see this screen, open a Windows command prompt and enter bash. Note the Ubuntu app installer can pin shortcuts to the Start Menu, or the Task Bar. I tried opening these and I did not get the above screenshot; it was missing the path (/mnt/c/Users/username$), and only showed my username@desktop. Running bash from Windows CMD included the expected path. Configuring the Linux subsystem You will have to install a few Linux packages. First, the basics. We need Python and Curl. To install those, enter sudo apt install python curl -y You can install multiple packages at once. The -Y option says yes to all questions during installation. So far so good, eh? Cloning betaflight If you already have the repository cloned to your computer and do not wish to use git, you can skip this step. To install git, enter: sudo apt install git Once that's done, navigate to the folder you want to have the repository cloned to. Use cd [folder name] to enter a folder, cd .. to go up a folder and ls to see the current folder's contents. Use mkdir [foldername] to create a new folder. Once that's done, enter git clone https://www.github.com/betaflight/betaflight [foldername] (be sure to have your GitHub login info ready). This will create a new folder within the folder you are in with the name you specified and clone (=download) the Betaflight repo into it. Building Betaflight Note: The file system mapping of WSL is still somewhat experimental, and currently all files on the local disk are mounted into /mnt/c on the linux side. They are accessible, but they are mounted with root:root permissions. This causes permissioning issues with a lot of things, and amongst them is that it leads to errors when trying to build Betaflight from a repository that was cloned onto the local disk under Windows. Rather than doing this, create a fresh clone in linux under /home/\\&lt;username\\&gt;, and build from there. To build Betaflight, you have two things left to install. Enter the folder you cloned the Betaflight repo into. The ls command should output something like this:If it doesn't match, you are in the wrong folder. Use the Windows file manager to help if you are lost. If you are missing a few folders, don't worry, we are going to solve that right now. First, enter sudo apt install build-essential. This is the package that will actually build Betaflight. Then, enter sudo make arm_sdk_install. UPDATE/NOTE: Using Ubuntu, I had to run sudo apt-get update which installed a few updates, prior to running sudo apt install build-essential. Without the updates, sudo apt install build-essential only produced 404 errors. Once that is done, your system is ready to spit out those sweet hex files. First use make configs to download the board targets. Enter make &lt;targetname&gt; to build Betaflight for your chosen board. For example make MATEKF411 or even make MATEKF411 MATEKH743 for multiple targets. make help is also your friend. Alternatively, you can try make all if you have some spare time. The hex files will be in the /obj folder of the betaflight folder TIP: To find your board (and how it should be referenced from the make command), see here: https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/tree/master/src/main/target UPDATE/NOTE 2: In order to run make test or make junittest you will have to install clang (version 10). If you type which clang-10 in console and get no output, it's not installed. In order to install enter sudo apt-get install clang-10. Additionally, you may need to run sudo apt-get install libblocksruntime-dev to install a missing library for linking. Optional items If you do not like the default Windows console, you can always install for example xterm. This will however also require an X-server running in the Windows host environment. Get it here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/ Then do the following in the Linux subsystem: $ sudo apt install xterm$ sudo apt-get install dbus-x11$ sudo dbus-uuidgen --ensure$ xterm --display :0.0 &amp; Root file system location The root file system for the Linux Subsystem is available from Windows here:C:\\Users\\\\&lt;username\\&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\\LocalState\\rootfs In earlier iterations of Windows Subsystem for Linux, the Ubuntu file system was at %localappdata%\\Lxss (e.g., C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Lxss But it has now moved to the location mentioned above. Beware there are still a lot of incorrect information about this floating around. Even on MS own site. Under normal circumstances, avoid doing anything in these folder as much as possible, it might mess up the Linux subsystem. Compiling unit tests To compile unit tests, you need to install two additional packages: $ sudo apt-get install clang$ sudo apt-get install libblocksruntime-dev Then run the following command to compile all unit tests: $ make test You can also compile them individually as well. For more usage information run this command: $ cd ./src/test &amp;&amp; make help","keywords":""},{"title":"Building in Arch Linux","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/development/Building-in-Arch-Linux","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Setup GNU ARM Toolchain​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Building in Arch Linux","url":"/docs/development/Building-in-Arch-Linux#setup-gnu-arm-toolchain","content":"pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib arm-none-eabi-binutils  For running tests, the libblocksruntime package from the AUR also has to be installed: trizen -S libblocksruntime  At the time of writing, the repository version of GCC is 9.2.0, unlike 9.2.1 which BetaFlight expects.

So use a space after these keywords: if, switch, case, for, do, while  but not with sizeof, typeof, alignof, or attribute. E.g., s = sizeof(struct file);  When declaring pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type, the preferred use of '*' is adjacent to the data name or function name and not adjacent to the type name. Examples: char *linux_banner; memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr); char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);  Use one space around (on each side of) most binary and ternary operators, such as any of these: = + - &lt; &gt; * / % | &amp; ^ &lt;= &gt;= == != ? :  but no space after unary operators: &amp; * + - ~ ! sizeof typeof alignof __attribute__ defined  no space before the postfix increment &amp; decrement unary operators: ++ --  no space after the prefix increment &amp; decrement unary operators: ++ --  and no space around the '.' and &quot;-&gt;&quot; structure member operators. '*' and '&amp;', when used for pointer and reference, shall have no space between it and the following variable name. typedef enums that do not have a count or some other form of terminator element shall have a comma after their last element: typedef enum { MSP_RESULT_ACK = 1, MSP_RESULT_ERROR = -1, MSP_RESULT_NO_REPLY = 0, MSP_RESULT_CMD_UNKNOWN = -2, } mspResult_e;  This ensures that, if more elements are added at a later stage, only the additional lines show up in the review, making it easier to review. enums with a count should have that count declared as the last item in the enumeration list, so that it is automatically maintained, e.g.: typedef enum { PID_CONTROLLER_MW23 = 0, PID_CONTROLLER_MWREWRITE, PID_CONTROLLER_LUX_FLOAT, PID_COUNT } pidControllerType_e;  It shall not be calculated afterwards, e.g. using PID_CONTROLLER_LUX_FLOAT + 1; typedef struct definitions should include the struct name, so that the type can be forward referenced, that is in: typedef struct motorMixer_s { float throttle; ... float yaw; } motorMixer_t;  the motorMixer_s name is required.

"},{"title":"Implementation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Coding style","url":"/docs/development/CodingStyle#implementation","content":"Keep functions short and distinctive. Think about unit test when you define your functions. Ideally you should implement the test cases before implementing the function. Never put multiple statements on a single line. Never put multiple assignments on a single line. Never put multiple assignments in a single statement. Defining constants using pre-processor macros is not preferred. Const-correctness should be enforced. This allows some errors to be picked up at compile time (for example getting the order of the parameters wrong in a call to memcpy). A function should only read data from the HW once in each call, and preferably all at one place. For example, if gyro angle or time is needed multiple times, read once and store in a local variable. Use for loops (rather than do or while loops) for iteration. The use of continue or goto should be avoided. Same for multiple return from a function and multiple break inside a case. In general, they reduce readability and maintainability. In rare cases such constructs can be justified but only when you have considered and understood the alternatives and still have a strong reason. In expressions, parentheses should only be used where they are required, i.e. where operator precedence will not evaluate in the right order, or where a compiler warning is triggered without parentheses. This brings all expressions into a canonical form, and avoids the problem of different developers having different ideas of what 'easy to read' expressions are. One exception to this rule is the ternary conditional operator pidStabilisationEnabled = (pidControllerState == PID_STABILISATION_ON) ? true : false  Here, the condition shall be enclosed in braces, to make the ternary operator easier to spot when reading left to right. Includes All files must include their own dependencies and not rely on includes from the included files or that some other file was included first. Do not include things you are not using. #pragma once (see wiki) is preferred over #include guards to avoid multiple includes. Documentation comments All new code files, structs, enums, and functions should include a comment at its top describing its purpose. All PRs that modify existing items should add a comment if not already present, and update it if applicable due to changes made by the PR. These comments may be ommitted if the item is trivial or self-explanatory. Example file-level comment: /* This file contains code used to send DSHOT commands using the STM timer's burst DMA functionality. * It uses DMA to alter timer PWM duty cycle. For an alternative approach, see `drivers/dshot_bitbang.c` for a DSHOT implementation that uses GPIO bitbanging. */  Example enum-level comment: /* * Describes allocation of ELRS telemetry packets, and is associated with time between telemetry * packet transmission. * See [ELRS: Telemetry Bandwidth](https://www.expresslrs.org/1.0/info/telem-bandwidth/) for more information. */ typedef enum { TLM_RATIO_NO_TLM = 0, // ..  Other details No trailing whitespace at the end of lines or at blank lines. Stay within 120 columns, unless exceeding 120 columns significantly increases readability and does not hide information. (Less is acceptable. More than 140 makes it difficult to read on Github so that shall never be exceeded.) Take maximum possible advantage of compile time checking, so generally warnings should be as strict as possible. Don't call or reference &quot;upwards&quot;. That is don't call or use anything in a software layer that is above the current layer. The software layers are not that obvious in Betaflight, but we can certainly say that device drivers are the bottom layer and so should not call or use anything outside the device drivers. Target specific code (e.g. #ifdef CC3D) is not permissible outside of the src/main/target directory. typedef void handlerFunc(void); is easier to read than typedef void (*handlerFuncPtr)(void);. Code should be spherical. That is its surface area (public interfaces) relative to its functionality should be minimised. Which is another way of saying that the public interfaces shall be easy to use, do something essential and all implementation should be hidden and unimportant to the user Code should work in theory as well as in practice. It should be based on sound mathematical, physical or computer science principles rather than just heuristics. This is important for test code too. Tests shall be based on such principles and real-world properties so they don't just test the current implementation as it happens to be. Guidelines not tramlines: guidelines are not totally rigid - they can be broken when there is good reason.

Before using Betaflight at all, it's highly recommended that you, first, check to make sure your MCU and your peripherals are supported. Checking the Supported Sensors and Hardware Reference wiki pages are good places to look. Betaflight is supported across many STM32 processors. Second, thoroughly test the functionality of your hardware by programming your board in an IDE (i.e. STMCube) or using any other hardware debugging methods/tools. Assuming your hardware is supported and you've thoroughly tested your peripherals, flash generic firmware into your board. It's recommended to flash betaflight firmware using the configurator and USB Flashing. To create your own configuration, you must first use the resource command in the command line interface to map your peripheral pins on your controller. Use the CLI documentation linked above and other wiki pages for command reference. Then, you use the set command to set the bus type, i2c address, lowpass filter frequency/type, baro_hardware, gyro_hardware, etc. This will mainly be dependent on your hardware and will involve a lot of trial and error. Use the save command to save your configuration and reboot the controller. If your hardware is not detected, then you need to modify or create more settings in the CLI to accurately describe your hardware to Betaflight to detect it. Use your custom board's and respective peripherals' datasheets and schematics to help you. Alongside resource and set commands, there are timer and dma commands. For certain functions, such as battery voltage monitoring and motor output, you need to associate a timer and/or a Direct Memory Access (DMA) channel to those pins for those to work. # timertimer &lt;pin&gt; AF(x) [1-3]# dmadma [SPI_TX|ADC|pin] [index|pin] [0|1] For custom configuration like this outside the normal use-case, it's recommended that you use the pre-made configs as a source of reference.","keywords":""},{"title":"Controls","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/development/Controls","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Arming​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Controls","url":"/docs/development/Controls#arming","content":"When armed, the aircraft is ready to fly and the motors will spin when throttle is applied.

In the actual version, for example: #define USE_CLI #define USE_RX_PPM #define USE_RX_PWM #define USE_SERIALRX #define USE_SERIALRX_CRSF // Team Black Sheep Crossfire protocol #define USE_SERIALRX_IBUS // FlySky and Turnigy receivers #define USE_SERIALRX_SBUS // Frsky and Futaba receivers #define USE_SERIALRX_SPEKTRUM // SRXL, DSM2 and DSMX protocol #define USE_SERIALRX_SUMD // Graupner Hott protocol #define USE_SERIALRX_SUMH // Graupner legacy protocol #define USE_SERIALRX_XBUS // JR  The next part are features enabled if your memory flash size is bigger than 64 megabits. #if (FLASH_SIZE &gt; 64) #define BLACKBOX #define LED_STRIP #define TELEMETRY #define TELEMETRY_FRSKY #define TELEMETRY_HOTT #define TELEMETRY_LTM #define TELEMETRY_SMARTPORT #define USE_RESOURCE_MGMT #define USE_SERVOS #endif  And bigger than 128 megabits: #if (FLASH_SIZE &gt; 128) #define GPS #define CMS #define TELEMETRY_CRSF #define TELEMETRY_IBUS #define TELEMETRY_JETIEXBUS #define TELEMETRY_MAVLINK #define TELEMETRY_SRXL #define USE_DASHBOARD #define USE_MSP_DISPLAYPORT #define USE_RX_MSP #define USE_SERIALRX_JETIEXBUS #define USE_SENSOR_NAMES #define VTX_COMMON #define VTX_CONTROL #define VTX_SMARTAUDIO #define VTX_TRAMP #endif  Another interesting thing of this file, are others features deactivated by the computing capacity of the flight controller, or the model of the processor.

Any changes in this file will overwrite the default settings, so this file is the place where you must touch to create your custom firmware. The first thing to do is to #undef all the features that we want to disable from the common_pre.h.

With this space, we will add GPS and telemetry by iBus too, adding some #define that are only activated by default for flight controllers with more than 128 megabits: #define GPS #define TELEMETRY_IBUS  Be careful, some features are dependent, for example, the TELEMETRY_IBUS needs the TELEMETRY enabled. To customize more if needed, this file defines all the hardware supported by different versions of the flight controller, for example, in the NAZE file: #define GYRO #define USE_GYRO_MPU3050 #define USE_GYRO_MPU6050 #define USE_GYRO_MPU6500 #define USE_GYRO_SPI_MPU6500 #define ACC #define USE_ACC_ADXL345 #define USE_ACC_BMA280 #define USE_ACC_MMA8452 #define USE_ACC_MPU6050 #define USE_ACC_MPU6500 #define USE_ACC_SPI_MPU6500 #define BARO #define USE_BARO_MS5611 // needed for Flip32 board #define USE_BARO_BMP280  Here you have different gyroscopes, accelerometers and barometers defined, to support all the variants of the flight controller. You can comment all the models that you're sure that your flight controller is not using and you will get some free space. You can find too some features disabled for this flight controller, in this case, for example: /* #define MAG #define USE_MAG_HMC5883 #define MAG_HMC5883_ALIGN CW180_DEG */  The magnetometer is commented. If you uncomment it, then it will be activated and you can use it in the NAZE flight controller.

This has a number of significant drawbacks. In those analogue protocols subtle timing variations are a phenomenon we all know as jitter. This is where the signal jumps around the desired point. The shorter the pulse width the higher the likelihood and impact of this jitter. We have all seen an example of jitter in the receiver tab of the respective xFlight configurators. Variations in the pulse width also result in an unknown zero throttle, and an unknown maximum throttle. It is this reason that calibration of ESCs is required when using PWM. Pretty much all digital communications use timing and voltage levels against some form of reference (usually a ground) to indicate bit values. Serial (e.g. RS232, RS485 etc) uses the high (voltage &gt; reference) to indicate a bit value of 1, and a low (voltage closely approximating reference or &lt; reference) to represent a bit value of 0. In the case of serial each end of the communication needs to know the timing to utilise as consecutive bits in a 1 state are merely continuously highs (no pulses). The baud rate is therefore critical. In the case of DSHOT the timing is less critical. The reason for this is that the pulse width (duration) as a proportion of the total period denotes the bit value. This is very similar to the way in which WS2811/2 LED Strips work. In fact aside from the different timings, it would be pretty much identical.

For DSHOT300, and DSHOT150 it is essentially the same, but the bit-rate is slowed, for 300 (300 kilo-bits per second) it is 2x slower, for 150 (150 kilo-bits per second) it is 4 times slower. This means the timing above is simply x2 for 300, and x4 for 150. DSHOT300 and DSHOT150 were introduced to ensure that support for older less capable ESCs exists so flyers can get the benefit of digital accuracy. DSHOT bucks the trend, the higher number is faster than the lower numbers. The oneshot protocols (including Multishot) have used increasingly lower numbers to signify faster speeds.

So these timings can be off slightly and the result will still be the same. As with any protocol there needs to be a communication stream of bits, that will be interpreted for some outcome to occur. For the case of DSHOT the signal for a motor update consists of 16 bits (a frame). The first 11 bits are the actual throttle value. The next bit is to signal the ESC to provide a telemetry update (using a separate return channel), and the remaining 4 bits are a checksum.

In the throttle value portion of the frame the most significant bits are first, so the first bit having a value of 1 means the throttle is at least half way, i.e. 1024, the second bit represents 512, the third 256 and so on until bit 11 represents the value of 1.

The following graph represents the full throttle timing of the current protocols: DSHOT has no real concept of minimum and maximum durations for timing, it is a digital protocol afterall.

It is unlikely that F1 processors (Naze, CC3D etc) will be able to support it, due to the direct memory access requirements of the hardware. Those processors just don’t have enough DMA channels available. F3, F4 and F7 all have more than enough. However inside those processors certain mappings exist – between timers, DMA and the actual pins – and so it is possible we will find a target where you won’t be able to simply use motor outputs 1 to 4, but may have to move to motors 1, 2, 4 and 5 (as an example). Resource remapping in Betaflight 3.1 when released will make this task nice and easy (aside from any soldering if needed). For ESCs the hardware requirements will mean BLHeli_s or better. There are also ARM based ESCs, such as KISS 24A RACE, that will support DSHOT or are able to be upgraded to support it. Unfortunately the old ATMEL and slower SILABs based ESCs are unlikely to ever have the power nor timing hardware needed to support DSHOT. Either way it will mean a firmware upgrade, and in some cases this will mean soldering if the ESC does not have a boot loader that allows simplified firmware updates.

Digital is simply accurate. There is no jitter (variations in throttle value created due to timing). If the signal is corrupted the ESC can detect it through the checksum. Many will have found motor updates of 32khz appear smoother. This is most likely to do with the repeating signal being “averaged” out effectively and thus effectively filtering (smoothing) the jitter. DSHOT eliminates this PWM jitter, and therefore motor updates need not occur anymore frequently than a motor can actually physically adjust – and make no mistake there is a physical limit as to how quick a motor can change its speed. Another benefit is of course, no calibration required. In the digital world a zero is just that, a zero.

This 16 bit value is then GCR encoded to a 20 bit value by applying the following map nibble-wise: 0 -&gt; 19 1 -&gt; 1b 2 -&gt; 12 3 -&gt; 13 4 -&gt; 1d 5 -&gt; 15 6 -&gt; 16 7 -&gt; 17 8 -&gt; 1a 9 -&gt; 09 a -&gt; 0a b -&gt; 0b c -&gt; 1e d -&gt; 0d e -&gt; 0e f -&gt; 0f  This creates a 20 bit value which has no more than two consecutive zeros. This value is mapped to a new 21 bit value by starting with a bit value of 0 and changing the bit value in the next bit if the current bit in the incoming value is a 1, but repeating the previous bit value otherwise. Example: 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 would become 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0. This 21 bit value is then sent uninverted at a bitrate of 5/4 * the dshot bitrate. So Dshot 3 uses 375 kbit, dshot 600 uses 750 kbit. The esc needs to be ready after 40us + one dshot frame length to receive the next dshot packet.

Fallback settings are applied to all channels and a short amount of time is provided to allow for recovery. Note: Prior to entering stage 1, fallback settings are also applied to individual AUX channels that have invalid pulses. Stage 1 can also directly be activated when a transmitter switch that is configured to control the failsafe mode is switched ON and failsafe_switch_mode is set to STAGE1. Stage 1 will be aborted if the switch is moved to the OFF position before Stage 2 is engaged (see next).

The Stage 1 duration may be customised via the &quot;Guard time for stage 2 activation&quot; parameter in Configurator (failsafe_delay in the CLI). It starts at the time of the last good packet. The units are tenths of a second. During Stage 1 failsafe, all stick positions are set to the fixed 'fallback' values as specified in the 'Channel fallback settings' panel in Configurator, after the 300ms 'hold last good values' period expires. When initiated by a switch, the aux channels remain active, and there is no hold period - the effect is immediate Default behaviour is to center the sticks, set throttle stick to zero (causing the motors to idle), and hold the existing switch positions.

The switch should be configured (using Modes) to enable failsafe, and the failsafe_switch_mode should be set to STAGE1. The switch emulates a signal loss, but there are some differences. The main difference is that channels go immediately to Stage 1 values without waiting for any hold or signal evaluation periods. While in Stage 1, returning the switch to the OFF position will restore normal control immediately, just like re-gaining signal during Stage 1. Note that if the switch is held ON for longer than the failsafe_delay period, the flight controller will enter Stage 2 (see below), and, depending on how Stage 2 is configured, may immediately drop and disarm, from which recovery will not be immediate.

This can sometimes cause confusion when testing failsafe - always test with throttle up at some point before the test.

This allows for the implementation of the functionality that controls the radio chip, and translates the received signals into RC control signals as part of the firmware. This has a number of advantages: the RX can be directly added to the flight controller board, allowing for smaller builds (after all, not many people want to use a flight controller without an RX);it does not require one or more extra UARTs on the flight controller, and there is no risk of problems caused by a wrong UART configuration;it does not require an extra MCU to control the radio chip, and can therefore be produced / sold cheaper;since the RX 'firmware' is part of the flight controller firmware, fixes and updates will be applied as part of flight controller firmware updates, eliminating the need for (often cumbersome) RX firmware updates. But there are also disadvantages: a flight controller board will only have one radio chip, and will only be able to support the RC protocols that are using this chip.

These devices are sensitive to shocks. When the device is not yet installed to an aircraft, it has very little mass by itself. If you drop or bump the controller, a big force will be applied on its accelerometers, which could potentially damage them. Bottom line: Handle the board very carefully until it's installed on an aircraft! For an overview of the hardware Cleanflight (hereby CF) can run on, see Boards.md. For information about specific boards, see the board specific documentation. Assuming that you have a flight controller board (hereby FC) in hand, you should first read through the manual that it came with. You can skip the details about software setup, as we'll cover that here. Decide how you'll connect your receiver by reading the receiver chapter, and how many pins you need on the outputs (to connect ESCs and servos) by reading about Mixers. If you're interested in monitoring your flight battery with CF, see Battery Monitoring. You may want audible feedback from your copter so skim through Buzzer and mark the pins that will be used. Do you want your RC Receiver's RSSI to be sent to the board? The RSSI chapter explains how. You may or may not need to make an additional connection from your Receiver to the FC. Would you like to try using a GPS unit to get your aircraft to Loiter or Return-To-Launch? Take a look at the GPS. You may also want to read the Serial chapter to determine what extra devices (such as Blackbox, OSD, Telemetry) you may want to use, and how they should be connected. Now that you know what features you are going to use, and which pins you need, you can go ahead and solder them to your board, if they are not soldered already. Soldering only the pins required for the application may save weight and contribute to a neater looking setup, but if you need to use a new feature later you may have to unmount the board from the craft and solder missing pins, so plan accordingly. Before soldering your FC please review a how-to-solder tutorial to avoid expensive mistakes, practice soldering on some scrap before soldering your FC. If you are going to use Oneshot125, you may need to enable that on your ESCs using a jumper or flashing them with the latest stable firmware and enable Damped Light in their settings, if it's supported. Refer to the ESCs' documentation or online discussions to determine this. "},{"title":"Software setup​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"/docs/development/Getting-Started#software-setup","content":"Now that your board has pins on it, you are ready to connect it to your PC and flash it with CF. Install the Chromium browser or Google Chrome to your PC, if you don't have it already, add the Cleanflight Configurator to it, and start it. Then follow these instructions for Installation of the firmware to the FC. "},{"title":"Cleanflight Configuration​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"/docs/development/Getting-Started#cleanflight-configuration","content":"Your FC should now be running CF, and you should be able to connect to it using the Configurator. If that is not the case, please go back to the previous sections and follow the steps carefully. Now, there are two ways to configure CF; via the Configurator's tabs (in a &quot;graphical&quot; way, clicking through and selecting/changing values and tickboxes) and using the Command Line Interface (CLI). Some settings may only be configurable using the CLI and some settings are best configured using the GUI (particularly the ports settings, which aren't documented for the CLI as they're not human friendly). It is now a good time to setup your RC Receiver and Transmitter. Set the Tx so that it outputs at least 4 channels (Aileron, Elevator, Throttle, Rudder) but preferably more. E.g. you can set channels 5 and 6 to be controlled by 3-position switches, to be used later. Maybe set up EXPO on AIL/ELE/RUD, but you should know that it can also be done in CF's software later. If using RSSI over PPM or PWM, it's now time to configure your Rx to output it on a spare channel. Connect the Rx to the FC, and the FC to the PC. You may need to power the Rx through a BEC (its 5V rail - observe polarity!). On your PC, connect to the Configurator, and go to the first tab. Check that the board animation is moving properly when you move the actual board. Do an accelerometer calibration. Configuration tab: Select your aircraft configuration (e.g. Quad X), and go through each option in the tab to check if relevant for you. E.g. you may want to enable ONESHOT125 for Oneshot-capable ESCs. You may need RX_PPM if you're using an RC Receiver with PPM output etc. If planning to use the battery measurement feature of the FC, check VBAT under Battery Voltage. If using analog RSSI, enable that under RSSI. Do not enable this setting if using RSSI injected into the PPM stream. Motors will spin by default when the FC is armed. If you don't like this, enable MOTOR_STOP. Also, adjust the minimum, middle and maximum throttle according to these guidelines: Minimum Throttle - Set this to the minimum throttle level that enables all motors to start reliably. If this is too low, some motors may not start properly after spindowns, which can cause loss of stability and control. A typical value would be 1100.Middle Throttle - The throttle level for middle stick position. Many radios use 1500, but some (e.g. Futaba) may use 1520 or other values.Maximum Throttle - The maximum throttle level that the ESCs should receive. A typical value would be 2000.Minimum Command - This is the &quot;idle&quot; signal level that will be sent to the ESCs when the craft is disarmed, which should not cause the motors to spin. A typical value would be 1000. Finally, click Save and Reboot. Receiver tab: Check that the channel inputs move according to your Tx inputs.Check that the Channel map is correct along with the RSSI Channel, if you use that.Verify the range of each channel goes from ~1000 to ~2000. See also controls. and rx_min_usec and rx_max_usec.You can also set EXPO here instead of your Tx.Click Save! Modes tab: Setup the desired modes. See the modes chapter for what each mode does, but for the beginning you mainly need HORIZON, if any. Before finishing this section, you should calibrate the ESCs, install the FC to the frame, and connect the RSSI cable, buzzer and battery if you have chosen to use those.

When flying in Acro mode (yaw tune in other modes possible as well - see below) you can activate G-Tune with an AUX box (switch) while the copter is armed. It will start tuning the wanted / possible axis (see below) in a predefined range (see below). After activation you will probably notice nothing! That means G-Tune will not start shaking your copter, you will have to do it (or simply fly and let it work). The G-Tune is based on the gyro error so it is only active when you give no RC input (that would be an additional error). So if you just roll only pitch and yaw are tuned. If you stop rolling G-Tune will wait ca. 450ms to let the axis settle and then start tuning that axis again. All axis are treated independently. The easiest way to tune all axis at once is to do some air-jumps with the copter in Acro (RC centered and G-Tune activated... of course..). You can set a too high P for the axis as default in the GUI, when the copter starts shaking the wobbles will be detected and P tuned down (be careful with the strength setting though - see below). Yaw tune is disabled in any copter with less than 4 motors (like tricopters). G-Tune in Horizon or Level mode will just affect Yaw axis (if more than 3 motors...) You will see the results in the GUI - the tuning results will only be saved if you enable G-Tune mode while the copter is disarmed and G-Tune was used before when armed. You also can save the configuration in an alternative way (like hitting save button in the GUI, casting an eepromwrite with trimming, acc calibration etc.) TPA and G-Tune: It is not tested and will most likely not result into something good. However G-Tune might be able to replace TPA for you. A typical use may go in this order: ArmEnable G-tuneLift off slowly, avoid stick inputs (Roll, Pitch / Yaw).Eventually the copter should fly well. Perhaps do a few throttle punch outs and fly around a bit. Take note if each punch out seems to become smoother with less oscillation and the overall flight performance.Disable G-tuneLandDisarm, but don’t power off.If these are desired results then either a) Connect cleanflight configurator review and save the configuration. or b) Enable G-Tune again to save settings.Power off. If the results are not desired look into changing the parameters as shown below and try again.

The preset range (GUI: 1.0 - 10.0) is quiet broad to represent most setups. If you want tighter or more loose ranges change them here. gtune_loP_XXX can be configured lower than &quot;10&quot; that means a P of &quot;1.0&quot; in the GUI. So you can have &quot;Zero P&quot; but you may get sluggish initial control. If you want to exclude one axis from the tuning you must set gtune_hiP_XXX to zero. Let's say you want to disable yaw tuning write in CLI set gtune_hiP_yw = 0. Note: The MultiWii Wiki advises you to trim the yaw axis on your transmitter. If you have done so (yaw not neutral on your RC) yaw tuning will be disabled. You can adjust the strength of tuning by using set gtune_pwr = N. My small copter works fine with 0 and doesn't like a value of &quot;3&quot;. My big copter likes &quot;gtune_pwr = 5&quot;. It shifts the tuning to higher values and if too high can diminish the wobble blocking! So start with 0 (default). If you feel your resulting P is always too low for you, increase gtune_pwr. You will see it getting a little shaky if value is too high.

"},{"title":"Overview​","type":1,"pageTitle":"In-flight Adjustments","url":"/docs/development/Inflight-Adjustments#overview","content":"There are two modes of operation. The first supports adjusting settings by incrementing/decrementing them through use of an aux channel, typically a three position switch, where the middle position makes no change, and the other positions either increment or decrement the selected setting. The other mode is Absolute mode where a pot (knob/slider) may be directly mapped and changes the selected setting to a value based on a center value, corresponding to mid-postion on the pot and a range of ± adjustment at the min/max positions of the pot. Both modes utilise two channels to make an adjustment. Channel\tUseRange\tThis channel is used to enable an adjustment. When the channel is set to fall withing the specified range, then the corresponding adjustment is enabled. This is similar to mode setting where a given mode is enabled when a channel is within a lower and upper range. Adjustment\tThis channel is used to control the change to the specified setting Settings are not saved automatically, connect a GUI, refresh and save or save using stick position when disarmed. Powering off without saving will discard the adjustments. Settings can be saved when disarmed using stick positions: Throttle Low, Yaw Left, Pitch Low, Roll Right. "},{"title":"Increment/Decrement mode​","type":1,"pageTitle":"In-flight Adjustments","url":"/docs/development/Inflight-Adjustments#incrementdecrement-mode","content":"Up to 4 RX channels can be used to make different adjustments at the same time. The adjustment the Adjustment Channel makes is controlled by the Range Channel. The available adjustments are listed in this table. Example scenarios: Up to 4 3-position switches or pots can be used to adjust 4 different settings at the same time. A single 2/3/4/5/6/x position switch can be used to make one 3 position switch adjust one setting at a time. Any combination of switches and pots can be used. So you could have 6 POS switch. Adjustment switches​ The Adjustment switch is associated with the Adjustment Channel. The switch can be a ON-OFF-ON, POT or momentary ON-OFF-ON switch. The latter is recommended. When the switch is returned to the center position the value will not be increased/decreased. Each time you can press the switch high/low and then return it to the middle the value will change at least once, you do not have to wait before pressing the switch again if you want to increase/decrease at a faster rate. While the adjustment switch held is high/low, the adjustment function applies and increases/decreases the value being adjusted twice a second and the flight controller will beep shorter/longer, respectively. The system works similar to how a keyboard repeat delay works. Hint: With OpenTX transmitters you can combine two momentary OFF-ON switches to control a single channel. You could make it so that a momentary switch on the left of your transmitter decreases the value and a momentary switch on the right increases the value. Experiment with your mixer!

This provides an easier approach than using the Increment/Decrement mode as it is easier to keep track of the setting. Note that if the same pot is used as the Adjustment Channel to make multiple adjustments, there is a risk of a jump in values of the second setting when switching from the first if the pot is not centered. To avoid this it is recommended that if adjusting two different settings using the same pot, a three position switch be used for the Range Channel, with neither setting associated with the middle position.

Yaw gyro changes happen primarily due to inertia when the RPM of the motors change. A constant acceleration of yaw requires a constant rate of increase/decrease in the RPM of the yaw motor pairs. This means that on Yaw I has the effect of P and P the effect of D. FF is a control element that adds impetus based on the acceleration in setpoint rate. This results in several issues on yaw. Typically yaw will react very fast initially, then fall back and catch up again over time. Integrated Yaw fixes this by integrating the output of the yaw pid before applying them to the mixer. This normalizes the way the pids work. You can now tune as any other axis. It requires use of absolute control since no I is needed with Integrated Yaw.

Make sure I is low or zero since significant I leads to strong oscillations. Pitch and roll might require slight retuning - primarily reducing I a bit since absolute control acts similar to a second I term.

It accepts data in the form of 8 bits each of Green-Red-Blue. With the SK6812 also GRBW variants are supported, which have a fourth (white) channel and such provide a much cleaner white color.

WS2812 LEDs on full brightness can consume quite a bit of current. It is recommended to verify the current draw and ensure your supply can cope with the load. On a multirotor that uses multiple BEC ESC's you can try use a different BEC to the one the FC uses. e.g. ESC1/BEC1 -&gt; FC, ESC2/BEC2 -&gt; LED strip. It's also possible to power one half of the strip from one BEC and the other half from another BEC. Just ensure that the GROUND is the same for all BEC outputs and LEDs.

Additionally, since RC5 is also used for Parallel PWM RC input on both the Naze, Chebuzz and STM32F3Discovery targets, led strips can not be used at the same time at Parallel PWM. If you have LEDs that are intermittent, flicker or show the wrong colors then drop the VIN to less than 4.7v, e.g. by using an inline diode on the VIN to the LED strip. The problem occurs because of the difference in voltage between the data signal and the power signal. The WS2811 LED's require the data signal (Din) to be between 0.3 Vin (Max) and 0.7 VIN (Min) to register valid logic low/high signals. The LED pin on the CPU will always be between 0v to ~3.3v, so the Vin should be 4.7v (3.3v / 0.7 = 4.71v). Some LEDs are more tolerant of this than others.

GUI: Enable the Led Strip feature via the GUI under setup. Configure the LEDs from the Led Strip tab in the Betaflight GUI. First setup how the LEDs are laid out so that you can visualize it later as you configure and so the flight controller knows how many LEDs there are available. There is a step by step guide on how to use the GUI to configure the Led Strip feature using the GUI http://blog.oscarliang.net/setup-rgb-led-cleanflight/ which was published early 2015 by Oscar Liang which may or may not be up-to-date by the time you read this. CLI: Enable the LED_STRIP feature via the cli: feature LED_STRIP  If you enable LED_STRIP feature and the feature is turned off again after a reboot then check your config does not conflict with other features, as above. Configure the LEDs using the led command. The led command takes either zero or two arguments - an zero-based led number and a sequence which indicates pair of coordinates, direction flags and mode flags and a color. If used with zero arguments it prints out the led configuration which can be copied for future reference. Each led is configured using the following template: x,y:ddd:mmm:cc x and y are grid coordinates of a 0 based 16x16 grid, north west is 0,0, south east is 15,15ddd specifies the directions, since an led can face in any direction it can have multiple directions. Directions are: N - NorthE - EastS - SouthW - WestU - UpD - Down For instance, an LED that faces South-east at a 45 degree downwards angle could be configured as SED. Note: It is perfectly possible to configure an LED to have all directions NESWUD but probably doesn't make sense. mmm specifies the modes that should be applied an LED. Each LED has one base function: C - Color.F - Flight mode &amp; OrientationA - Armed state.R - Ring thrust state.G - GPS state.S - RSSSI level.L - Battery Level. And each LED has overlays: W - Wwarnings.I - Indicator.T - Thrust state.B - Blink (flash twice) mode.O - LarsOn Scanner (Cylon Effect).Y - Rainbow effect.V - VTX Frequency. cc specifies the color number (0 based index).

Note: this mode requires a current sensor. If you don't have the actual device you can set up a virtual current sensor (see Battery). Blink​ This mode blinks the current LED, alternatively from black to the current active color. Larson Scanner (Cylon Effect)​ The Larson Scanner replicates the scanning &quot;eye&quot; effect seen on the mechanical Cylons and on Kitt from Knight Rider. This overlay dims all of the LEDs it is assigned to and brightens certain ones at certain times in accordance with the animation. The animation is active regardless of arm state. Rainbow Effect​ This mode is cycling through HSV colors periodically. Animation frequency can be changed with set ledstrip_rainbow_freq = X and HSV color difference between adjacent LEDs with set ledstrip_rainbow_delta = Y. info Can also be used with Larson Scanner or Blink. VTX Frequency​ This overlay makes the LED color dependent on the current channel of the VTX, in case it is equipped with SmartAudio or IRC Tramp. The color is selected according to the following table: Frequency range\tDefault color\tColor index&lt;= 5672\tWhite\t1 &gt; 5672 &lt;= 5711\tRed\t2 &gt; 5711 &lt;= 5750\tOrange\t3 &gt; 5750 &lt;= 5789\tYellow\t4 &gt; 5789 &lt;= 5829\tGreen\t6 &gt; 5829 &lt;= 5867\tBlue\t10 &gt; 5867 &lt;= 5906\tDark violet\t11 &gt; 5906\tDeep pink\t13 The default color can be changed by double-clicking the color and moving the Hue slider or by using the color command in the CLI. Flight Mode &amp; Orientation​ This mode shows the flight mode and orientation. When flight modes are active then the LEDs are updated to show different colors depending on the mode, placement on the grid and direction. LEDs are set in a specific order: LEDs that marked as facing up or down.LEDs that marked as facing west or east AND are on the west or east side of the grid.LEDs that marked as facing north or south AND are on the north or south side of the grid. That is, south facing LEDs have priority. The mapping between modes led placement and colors is currently fixed and cannot be changed.

Note: Armed State cannot be used with Flight Mode. Thrust state​ This mode fades the current LED color to the previous/next color in the HSB color space depending on throttle stick position. When the throttle is in the middle position the color is unaffected, thus it can be mixed with orientation colors to indicate orientation and throttle at the same time. Thrust should normally be combined with Color or Mode/Orientation. Thrust ring state​ This mode is allows you to use one or multiple led rings (e.g. NeoPixel ring) for an afterburner effect. LEDs with this mode will light up with their assigned color in a repeating sequence. Assigning the color black to an LED with the ring mode will prevent the LED from lighting up. A better effect is achieved when LEDs configured for thrust ring have no other functions. LED direction and X/Y positions are irrelevant for thrust ring LED state. The order of the LEDs that have the state determines how the LED behaves, and the throttle value determines the animation rate. The animation is only active while armed. Each LED of the ring can be a different color. The color can be selected between the 16 colors available. For example, led 0 is set as a Ring thrust state led in color 13 as follow. led 0 2,2::R:13  LED strips and rings can be combined. Solid Color​ The mode allows you to set an LED to be permanently on and set to a specific color. x,y position and directions are ignored when using this mode. Other modes will override or combine with the color mode. For example, to set led 0 to always use color 10 you would issue this command. led 0 0,0::C:10  "},{"title":"Colors​","type":1,"pageTitle":"LED Strip","url":"/docs/development/LedStrip#colors","content":"Colors can be configured using the cli color command.

Suspension near the CG is ideal. Alternatively, you can just fly the vehicle and trigger the problematic condition you are trying to eliminate, although tuning will be more tedious. Tap the vehicle at its end in the axis under evaluation. Directly commanding the servo in question to move may also be used. In the tricopter example, tap the end of the tail boom from the side, or command a yaw using your transmitter. If your vehicle oscillates for several seconds or even continues oscillating indefinitely, then the filter cutoff frequency should be reduced. Reduce the value of servo_lowpass_freq by half its current value and repeat the previous step. If the oscillations are dampened within roughly a second or are no longer present, then you are done.

When a motor goes below minimum it gets clipped off. Say you had your throttle just above minimum and tried to pull a quick roll - since two motors can't go any lower, you essentially get half the power (half of your PID gain). If your inputs would have asked for more than a 100% difference between the high and low motors, the low motors would get clipped, breaking the symmetry of the motor balance by unevenly reducing the gain. Airmode will enable full PID correction during zero throttle and give you ability for nice zero throttle gliding and acrobatics. In addition, the cornering / turns will be much tighter now as there is always maximum possible correction performed. Airmode can also be enabled to work at all times by always putting it on the same switch such as your arm switch, alternatively you can enable/disable it in air. Additional points and benefits: Airmode will additionally fully enable Iterm at zero throttle. Note that there is still some protection on the ground when throttle zeroed (below min\\check) and roll/pitch sticks centered. This is a basic protection to limit motors spooling up on the ground.Also the Iterm will be reset above 70% of stick input in acro mode to prevent quick Iterm windups during finishes of rolls and flips, which will provide much cleaner and more natural stops of flips and rolls what again opens the ability to have higher I gains for some.

Layout your OSD using the configurator and save. Elements in the same position but on different profiles will overlap in the configurator at this stage. OSD Profiles can either be selected via an adjustment range (Adjustments tab, after enabling Expert Mode) or by setting the osd_profile parameter with the set command in the CLI. The selected OSD Profile can either be controlled from a switch on your radio or you can configure different profiles and select the one you want by using the set osd_profile=2 command in the CLI and saving. OSD Configuration​ Configure your OSD via the OSD tab in the configurator, i.e. element layout, font etc. as before. OPTION 1: Configure an adjustment range to change OSD Profile from your radio​ Turn on Expert mode - see top right of configurator screen &quot;Enable Expert Mode&quot;.The OSD Profile selection is performed using an adjustment configured via the Adjustments tab. Enable an adjustment. (&quot;If enabled&quot;)Select the AUX channel to be used to change OSD Profile. (&quot;when channel&quot;)Set the range to cover the entire range of the selected AUX channel. (&quot;is in ranges&quot;)For the action select &quot;RC Rate Adjustment&quot;. (&quot;then apply&quot;) This will be configured in the CLI since OSD Profiles is not supported by Configurator 10.4.0 and earlier. &quot;RC Rate Adjustment&quot; is only selected to make the configuration in the CLI a little easier below.Select the &quot;via channel&quot; to match the selected AUX channel of above. (&quot;when channel&quot;).Save Open the CLI and type adjrange followed by enter.Copy the adjrange configured in step 2. above and paste it in the command window. Change the '1' following the range of the channel to '29' and press enter. Type save and press enter. The configured adjrange will now be saved and the FC will reboot.Configure the AUX channel on your radio. When this channel is changed the selected OSD Profile will change displaying all the elements configured for the selected profile. Note that elements are assigned to profile 1 by default. To revert back to not using OSD Profiles, go to the CLI and select and type set osd_profile=1 press enter, followed by save and enter. Keep in mind that elements configured to be only visible on profile 2 and 3 will need to reconfigured and will not be visible on profile 1. OPTION 2: Use the CLI to select an OSD Profile (i.e. not selecting the OSD Profile with your radio)​ Open the CLI.Type get osd_profile followed by enter to display the currently selected profile.Type set osd_profile=x where x is the profile number 1,2 or 3 and press enter.Type save followed by enter to save the selected profile. CONFIGURE OSD PROFILES​ The steps below are only required if using The Configurator 10.4.0 or earlier. Open the CLI. Find the name of the element to be configured, all elements can be displayed using the dump command or get osd command. Element names end in _pos. Take the current value of the element, apply the OSD Profile config and set its new value using the set command. The OSD Profile config value is described below. eg. osd_vbat_pos = 6560set osd_vbat_pos = 31136save Repeat steps 2 &amp; 3 for every element to be configured. OSD PROFILE CONFIG VALUES​ The OSD Profile config is stored in the higher order bits, bits 11, 12 &amp; 13 of an OSD element, eg. osd_vbat_pos. This means the initial value, after being configured in the OSD tab needs to be adjusted to add the OSD Profile configuration of the element. To calculate the new value, take the current (initially configured value) of the OSD element and convert it to HEX. Determine which OSD Profiles this element should be visible on and select the corresponding HEX value from the table below. Perform an OR operation between the initial OSD element value (in HEX) and the HEX value from the table. Convert the result to decimal and set the OSD element to this value using the set command in the CLI. Binary Value HEX Value Profile Configuration Description 13 12 11 0 0 1 0x0800 - 1 Visible in OSD Profile 1 0 1 0 0x1000 - 2 Visible in OSD Profile 2 0 1 1 0x1800 - 1 and 2 Visible in OSD Profile 1 and 2 only 1 0 0 0x2000 - 3 Visible in OSD Profile 3 only 1 0 1 0x2800 - 1 and 3 Visible in OSD Profile 1 and 3 only 1 1 0 0x3000 - 2 and 3 Visible in OSD Profile 2 and 3 only 1 1 1 0x3800 - 1, 2 and 3 Visible in all OSD Profiles  Example: osd_vbat_pos = 6560Convert 6560 to HEX results in 19A0 (HEX) (All these operations can be done with the windows calculator in programmer mode)We want this element to be visible on OSD Profile 2 &amp; 3 and hence select the HEX value 0x3000 from the table above.OR the two HEX values together 19A0 OR 3000 = 39A0Convert 39A0 (HEX) to decimal results in 14752.In the CLI, set osd_vbat_pos = 14752 enter and save enter.

configuration data. With parameter groups, parameters are combined in logical groups (e.g. all the parameters for one particular device / feature go into one parameter group). These groups are modelled as data structures in the firmware. "},{"title":"Rules​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Parameter Groups","url":"/docs/development/ParameterGroups#rules","content":"The following rules have to be taken into consideration when dealing with parameter groups in code: Each feature or group of related features, hardware driver or group of related hardware drivers should use a parameter group of its own;A parameter group of any given ID and version shall be identical across all targets and build configurations - this means that nothing that is contained in a parameter group directly or indirectly can be conditional. The finest granularity for parameters to be available on a given target is by having or not having support for a given parameter group;The only exception to 2. are parameter group arrays. For parameter group arrays, it is permissible to have the length of the array defined conditionally. Because the length of the struct defining the array elements is fixed for any given version, and the overall size of the array is stored with the array, the length of the array can be calculated when reading it. This consideration only applies to parameter group arrays declared with PG_DECLARE_ARRAY, and the length supplied in the declaration. For the length of any arrays inside a parameter group struct (directly or nested), 2. applies;As a consequence of 1. and 2., all of the parameters required for the configuration of the feature or driver should be contained within this parameter group. If a parameter is required by more than one feature or driver, it shall be moved 'upwards' into a generic parameter group that all the features or drivers requiring the parameter depend upon - if necessary such a parameter group has to be created;New parameters should always be appended at the end of the parameter group. If this is the only change to the parameter group, there are no further changes required. Previously stored versions of the data in this parameter group can still be read. New elements will be initialised to 0 in this case. If 0 is an invalid value for a new parameter, this has to be treated as described in 6., in order to ensure the parameter is initialised to a valid value. If the parameter group that the new parameter is appended to is a parameter group array declared with PG_DECLARE_ARRAY, then the version of the parameter group has to be incremented as described in 6. as well, in order get the change in the struct properly handled;Any changes to a parameter group that are not covered in 5. (e.g. removing elements, changing the type of elements), the version of the parameter group (as defined in PG_REGISTER...) has to be incremented in order to make the code handling parameter groups aware that the format of the parameter group has changed and previously stored versions of it are now invalid;All changes to parameter group arrays (declared with PG_DECLARE_ARRAY()) or arrays contained within the struct of a parameter group require that the version of the parameter group (as defined in PG_REGISTER.. has to be incremented as well, and the same considerations as for 6. apply;When creating a new parameter group, the PG_DECLARE() / PG_DECLARE_ARRAY() shall be placed right after the definition of the struct used as the type of the parameter group in the code. This serves the purpose of making it easy for developers to determine when a struct they are working on is used in a parameter group and subject to these rules;Any struct that is used as an element in a struct that is used in a parameter group (directly or indirectly) is subject to constraints 6. and 7. above. In order to make it possible for developers to determine that this is the case, a comment // Used in parameter group &lt;group name&gt; shall be added after the definition of the struct for every parameter group that the struct is used in.

Check the description on the individual controller. TPA applies a PID value reduction in relation to full throttle. It is used to apply dampening of PID values as full throttle is reached. TPA = % of dampening that will occur at full throttle. tpa_breakpoint = the point in the throttle curve at which TPA will begin to be applied. An Example: With TPA = 50 (or .5 in the GUI) and tpa_breakpoint = 1500 (assumed throttle range 1000 - 2000) At 1500 on the throttle channel, the PIDs will begin to be dampened.At 3/4 throttle (1750), PIDs are reduced by approximately 25% (half way between 1500 and 2000 the dampening will be 50% of the total TPA value of 50% in this example)At full throttle (2000) the full amount of dampening set in TPA is applied. (50% reduction in this example)TPA can lead into increase of rotation rate when more throttle applied. You can get faster flips and rolls when more throttle applied due to coupling of PID's and rates. Only the PID controllers MWREWRITE and LUX are using a linear TPA implementation, where no rotation rates are affected when TPA is being used.  How and Why to use this? If you are getting oscillations starting at say 3/4 throttle, set tpa_breakpoint = 1750 or lower (remember, this is assuming your throttle range is 1000-2000), and then slowly increase TPA until your oscillations are gone. Usually, you will want tpa_breakpoint to start a little sooner than when your oscillations start so you'll want to experiment with the values to reduce/remove the oscillations.

The strength of the auto-leveling correction applied during Angle mode is controlled by the LEVEL &quot;P&quot; PID term which is labeled &quot;Angle&quot;, &quot;Strength&quot; in the GUI (prior to version v1.13.0 the parameter level_angle was used). This can be used to tune the auto-leveling strength in Angle mode compared to Horizon mode. The default is 50. The strength of the auto-leveling correction applied during Horizon mode is set by the LEVEL &quot;I&quot; PID term which is labeled &quot;Horizon&quot;, &quot;Strength&quot; in the GUI (prior to version v1.13.0 the parameter level_horizon was used). The default is also 50. The transition between self-leveling and acro behavior in Horizon mode is controlled by the LEVEL &quot;D&quot; term which is labeled &quot;Horizon&quot;, &quot;Transition&quot; in the GUI (prior to version of v1.13.0 the parameter sensitivity_horizon parameter was used) . This sets the percentage of your stick travel that should have self-leveling applied to it, so smaller values cause more of the stick area to fly using only the gyros. For example, at a setting of &quot;100&quot; for sensitivity horizon, 100% self-leveling strength will be applied at center stick, 50% self-leveling will be applied at 50% stick, and no self-leveling will be applied at 100% stick. If sensitivity is decreased to 75, 100% self-leveling will be applied at center stick, 50% will be applied at 63% stick, and no self-leveling will be applied at 75% stick and onwards. See below for descriptions of the Horizon Mode Commands.

"},{"title":"Filters​","type":1,"pageTitle":"PID tuning","url":"/docs/development/PID-tuning#filters","content":"gyro_lpf sets the hardware gyro low pass filter value. If 0 or 256 the gyro uses the least hardware filtering available (256Hz) and the internal sampling rate is the fastest possible (8kHz) with the least possible delay. The lower the number the stronger the filtering. Stronger filtering reduces noise in the gyro signal before that data gets into the PID calculations. Stronger filtering adds delays that can be associated with wobble and reduced responsiveness. Filtering is needed because motor/frame noise can cause overheating of motors especially when amplified by Dterm in quads with low mass and fast braking ESCs. If 188 or lower are chosen, the gyro sampling is internally at 1kHz and delays are greater. Faster sampling is good because things are slightly more responsive but can cause aliasing noise. Setting to 188 allows syncing of the FC to the gyro at 1kHz (if gyro_sync is enabled and available in the code) which reduces aliasing a lot. gyro_soft_lpf is an IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) software low-pass filter that can be configured to any desired frequency. If set to a value above zero it is active. It works after the hardware filter on the gyro (in the FC code) and further reduces noise. The two filters in series have twice the cut rate of one alone. There's not a lot of sense running gyro_soft_lpf at a value above gyro_lpf. If used, it is typically set about half the hardware filter rate to enhance the cut of higher frequencies before the PID calculations. Frequencies above 100Hz are of no interest to us from a flight control perspective - they can and should be removed from the signal before it gets to the PID calculation stage. dterm_cut_hz is an IIR software low-pass filter that can be configured to any desired frequency. It works after the gyro_cut filters and specifically filters only the D term data. D term data is frequency dependent, the higher the frequency, the greater the computed D term value. This filter is required if despite the gyro filtering there remains excessive D term noise. Typically it needs to be set quite low because D term noise is a major problem with typical IIR filters. If set too low the phase shift in D term reduces the effectiveness of D term in controlling stop wobble, so this value needs some care when varying it. Again blackbox recording is needed to properly optimise the value for this filter. "},{"title":"Horizon Mode Commands​","type":1,"pageTitle":"PID tuning","url":"/docs/development/PID-tuning#horizon-mode-commands","content":"The CLI commands horizon_tilt_effect and horizon_tilt_mode control the effect the current inclination has on self-leveling in the Horizon flight mode. (The current inclination is the number of degrees of pitch or roll that the vehicle is away from level, whichever is greater). horizon_tilt_effect: Controls the effect the current inclination (tilt) has on self-leveling in the Horizon flight mode. Larger values result in less self-leveling (more &quot;acro&quot;) as the tilt of the vehicle increases. The default value of 75 provides good performance when doing large loops and fast-forward flight. With a value of 0 the strength of the self-leveling would be solely dependent on the stick position. horizon_tilt_mode SAFE|EXPERT: Sets the performance mode for 'horizon_tilt_effect' SAFE = leveling always active when sticks centered: This is the &quot;safer&quot; range because the self-leveling is always active when the sticks are centered. So, when the vehicle is upside down (180 degrees) and the sticks are then centered, the vehicle will immediately be self-leveled to upright and flat. (Note that after this kind of very-fast 180-degree self-leveling, the heading of the vehicle can be unpredictable.) EXPERT = leveling can be totally off when inverted: In this range, the inclination (tilt) of the vehicle can fully &quot;override&quot; the self-leveling. In this mode, when the 'horizon_tilt_effect' parameter is set to around 75, and the vehicle is upside down (180 degrees) and the sticks are then centered, the vehicle is not self-leveled. This can be desirable for performing more-acrobatic maneuvers and potentially for 3D-mode flying. The 'horizon_tilt_effect' and 'horizon_tilt_mode' values are separate for each profile.

The low and high value of a channel range are often referred to as 'End-points'. e.g. 'End-point adjustments / EPA'. All attempts should be made to configure your transmitter/receiver to use the range 1000-2000 before using this feature as you will have less preceise control if it is used. To do this you should figure out what range your transmitter outputs and use these values for rx range configuration. You can do this in a few simple steps: If you have used rc range configuration previously you should reset it to prevent it from altering rc input. Do so by entering the following command in CLI: rxrange reset save  Now reboot your FC, connect the configurator, go to the Receiver tab move sticks on your transmitter and note min and max values of first 4 channels. Take caution as you can accidentally arm your craft. Best way is to move one channel at a time. Go to CLI and set the min and max values with the following command: rxrange &lt;channel_number&gt; &lt;min&gt; &lt;max&gt;  For example, if you have the range 1070-1930 for the first channel you should use rxrange 0 1070 1930 in the CLI. Be sure to enter the save command to save the settings. After configuring channel ranges use the sub-trim on your transmitter to set the middle point of pitch, roll, yaw and throttle. You can also use rxrange to reverse the direction of an input channel, e.g. rxrange 0 2000 1000.

Betaflight users should turn this off. The ADC filter converts what would otherwise be smooth changes in channel values into a series of steps, where each step is about 1% of the full stick travel. It is intended to reduce 'chatter' when the Rx is connected to a *servo, so that the servo only changes position when a meaningful change has occurred. It is not intended for use with flight controllers. When the ADC Filter is active, Betaflight does not receive the most recent position of the gimabl with each new RC packet. Instead, the Rx repeatedly provides the same data, until a moving-averaged smoothed estimate of gimbal position has increased by about 1% of full stick resolution. Betaflight needs a non-delayed, smooth and continuous representation of the stick travel to give the PID system a smooth target setpoint value. Our RC Smoothing is based on the assumption that every packet is unique and that each is a new representation of the most recent position of the gimbal. Feedforward is calculated from the packet-to-packet position difference, and absolutely relies on smooth and regular updates in measured gimbal position. When active with Betaflight firmware, the ADC filter causes: delay (from the moving averaging)sustained transient impactssteps in setpointspikes and noise in feedforward, with reduced feedforward precisionspikes in motor control signals that may cause noticeable jerking in HD video This is why, whenever an OpenTx or EdgeTx user is using Betaflight, the OpenTx/EdgeTx ADC Filter MUST be disabled, for accurate smooth flight control. The user only has to find the ADC Filter checkbox in the Hardware tab of the Global Settings for their radio, and ensure it is un-checked. For example, with the Frsky Taranis X9D+ pre 2019 model: Turn on your radio.Hold Menu to access Global Settings.Click the Page button 5 times to go to page 6 (HARDWARE).Scroll down and select ADC filter.Click Enter to disable the ADC filter as it's enabled by default.Click Exit (twice) to return to the startup screen.

This is useful to change the configuration of a Betaflight peripheral such as an OSD, bluetooth dongle, serial RX etc. To initiate passthrough mode, use the CLI command serialpassthrough This command takes four arguments. serialpassthrough &lt;port1 id&gt; [port1 baud] [port1 mode] [port1 DTR PINIO] [port2 id] [port2 baud] [port2 mode]  PortX ID is the internal identifier of the serial port from Betaflight source code (see serialPortIdentifier_e in the source). For instance UART1-UART4 are 0-3 and SoftSerial1/SoftSerial2 are 30/31 respectively. PortX Baud is the desired baud rate, and portX mode is a combination of the keywords rx and tx (rxtx is full duplex). The baud and mode parameters can be used to override the configured values for the specified port. port1 DTR PINIO identifies the PINIO resource which is optionally connected to a DTR line of the attached device. If port2 config(the last three arguments) is not specified, the passthrough will run between port1 and VCP. The last three arguments are used for Passthrough between UARTs, see that section to get detail. For example. If you have your MWOSD connected to UART 2, you could enable communicaton to this device using the following command. This command does not specify the baud rate or mode, using the one configured for the port (see above). serialpassthrough 1  If a baud rate is not specified, or is set to 0, then serialpassthrough supports changing of the baud rate over USB. This allows tools such as the MWOSD GUI to dynamically set the baud rate to, for example 57600 for reflashing the MWOSD firmware and then 115200 for adjusting settings without having to powercycle your flight control board between the two. To use a tool such as the MWOSD GUI, it is necessary to disconnect or exit Betaflight configurator. To exit serial passthrough mode, power cycle your flight control board. In order to reflash an Arduino based device such as a MWOSD via serialpassthrough if is necessary to connect the DTR line in addition to the RX and TX serial lines. The DTR is used as a reset line to invoke the bootloader. The DTR line may be connected to any GPIO pin on the flight control board. This pin must then be associated with a PINIO resource, the instance of which is then passed to the serialpassthrough command. If you don't need it, you can ignore it or set it to none. The DTR line associated with any given UART may be set using the CLI command resource specifying it as a PINIO resource. For example, the following configuration for an OpenPilot Revolution shows the UART6 serial port to be configured with TX on pin C06, RX on pin C07 and a DTR connection using PINIO on pin C08. resource SERIAL_TX 1 A09 resource SERIAL_TX 3 B10 resource SERIAL_TX 4 A00 resource SERIAL_TX 6 C06 resource SERIAL_RX 1 A10 resource SERIAL_RX 3 B11 resource SERIAL_RX 6 C07 resource PINIO 1 C08  To assign the DTR line to another pin use the following command. resource PINIO 1 c05  To disassociate DTR from a pin use the following command. resource PINIO 1 none  Having configured a PINIO resource assocaited with a DTR line as per the above example, connection to an MWOSD attached to an Openpilot Revolution could be achieved using the following command. serialpassthrough 5 0 rxtx 1 This will connect using UART 6, with the baud rate set over USB, full duplex, and with DTR driven on PINIO resource 1. A (desirable) side effect of configuring the DTR line to be associated with a PINIO resource, is that when the FC is reset, the attached Arduino device will also be reset. Note that if DTR is left configured on a port being used with a standard build of MWOSD firmware, the display will break-up when the flight controller is reset. This is because, by default, the MWOSD does not correctly handle resets from DTR. There are two solutions to this: Assign the DTR pin using the resource command above prior to reflashing MWOSD, and then dissasociate DTR from the pin.Rebuild MWOSD with MAX_SOFTRESET defined. The MWOSD will then be reset correctly every time the flight controller is reset.

We reserve the right to refuse to add Target Configurations that are in breach of these principles. Furthermore, target creators are advised to use common sense, and refrain from using configuration that is likely to annoy most users of their hardware - users are not likely to consider products from a manufacturer that has annoyed them in the past for future purchases. Another expectation is that Target Configurations that are submitted for publication are tested - please, in the interest of your customers, do not submit untested configurations. Instructions on how to install Betaflight with a new and unpublished Target Configuration can be found here. "},{"title":"1.2.

Don'ts​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to Create a Target Configuration","url":"/docs/manufacturer/creating-an-unified-target#13-donts","content":"These are things that will result in a Target Configuration being rejected by Betaflight, such as: any settings that are equal to the defaults in the firmware (e.g. resource ... NONE). Having such settings included results in targets that are more likely to break with new versions of the firmware, and are therefore harder to maintain and more likely to cause support issues;pre-setting any calibration settings that are dependent on and different for every board, like acc_calibration - these are designed for the user to be prompted to calibrate them when connecting to Betaflight Configurator, in order to get the correct calibration for their hardware;Target Configurations that result in safety issues or a setup that is potentially illegal to be used where the user is, such as: setting motor_pwm_protocol to any digital protocol - if this default configuration is used with ESCs that do not support digital protocols, it is likely to result in motors spinning up as soon as a battery is connected. The default of DISABLED is safe, and the user will be asked to select a motor protocol that is appropriate for their ESCs when they connect to Betaflight Configurator. (Exception: If a Target Configuration is to be used for an all-in-one / RTF product only, an appropriate value for motor_pwm_protocol for the on-board ESCs can be selected.)pre-setting any VTX table settings - allowable values for these are governed by law in most countries, and it is up to the manufacturer / supplier of the VTX hardware and the user to make sure that they are complying with the laws in their country. setting any values that default to auto-detection (like baro_hardware, mag_hardware) to NONE - the default of AUTO is designed to work with no hardware present, and setting the value to NONE will result in support issues from users wanting to add their own hardware. (Exception: Boards that do not have any pins or pads for an SPI or I2C bus exposed can define these settings as NONE.)pre-setting tuning settings for general purpose boards. Betaflight puts a lot of effort into shipping firmware with a default tune that is designed to work reliably across a wide range of hardware, and is extensively tested before every release. All of our documentation is based on this default tune. Adding a different tune to a Target Configuration will result in additional support issues from users for whom the instructions provided by Betaflight do not work. Furthermore, these custom defaults are likely to become outdated with future releases of Betaflight. (Exception: For Target Configurations that are used with only one RTF offering with fixed hardware, it may make sense to add a tune that is optimised for the hardware.)

Super expo is active when srates are set This means that if you used rc expo you may need to readjust it. Just lower it. Super expo feature is removed. Needs some cleanups though in the cli, but it is actually not there anymore. Superexpo is automatically active when you use srates (old rate). When 0 it is disabled. The ones who like to have linear rates without super expo can now increase rc rate. All rc rates above 2.0 are now having much higher incremental. 2.18 is I believe already 1000deg/sec and 2.55 is 2000deg/sec. Than you can add some rc expo. This new solution offers more flexible rate behavior for everyone. Also when you don't use rc expo now cpu usage will be lower as it the calculation is not performed anymore. Same for srates. If you don't use them than super expo calculations are not performed. The current configurator doesn't display these rates properly, but that will happen soon when configurator gets an update. Probably next week. set rc_interpolation = AUTO​ [OFF, PRESET, AUTO, MANUAL] This feature can cause the CPU to work harder to be able to run higher d setpoint weights and get cleaner motor outputs. Set to OFF if CPU loading is too high. Note: Auto rc interpolation detects rx speed based on the reported speed by rx itself.

Once throttle goes above this setting AirMode is enabled through the entire throttle range. set yaw_rate_acceleration_limit = 50?​ [0..200?]Changed to rate_accel_limit in RC12 Yaw rate accel limit is the betaflight (2DOF) PIDC replacement for yaw jump prevention. It works differently and much better. It prevents quick accelerations and decelerations of yaw axis, what were actually causing jumps. For the Legacy PIDC use &quot;d_yaw&quot;. What we do with sticks is pushing the multirotors beyond their limits, but pid controller still wants to correct that and ramps up the motors what causes jerky behavior. With accel limits the pid controller has a protection to limit the acceleration and make it smoother what also helps against iterm windups we have seen getting worse on yaw axis. Same can also be done for roll and pitch axis what is disabled by default. It can give much smoother flight characteristics. set gyro_lowpass_level = HIGH​ [NORMAL, HIGH] Sets how aggressive/steep the cutoff is. Steeper cutoff adds more delay compared to less steep one.

On top of that also the setpoint weight from 2DOF architecture is used for Derivative component. So technically it is a Kp, Ki, Kd, c from pid2 in here. Post from Boris about this differences between the Legacy and 2DOF PIDC:[http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=35460572&amp;postcount=35822] Post from Joshua explaining 2DOF PIDC and setpoint weight: Betaflight 3.0's new 2 degree-of-freedom PID controller is one of its most exciting features. Let's learn what the new &quot;setpoint weight&quot; sliders do! I also discuss the new RC interpolation feature. Error in a PID controller can be separated into externally-induced error and error caused by moving the set-point. The 2DOF PID controller allows you to distinguish between these two types of error. In other words, it allows you to control how aggressively the PID controller responds to your stick movements. P term setpoint weight basically controls overshoot. Higher P term setpoint weight results in sharper stick response, lower P gains, and more overshoot and oscillation. Lower P term setpoint weight results in softer stick response, higher P gains, and less overshoot and oscillation. D term setpoint weight is harder to describe. Higher D term setpoint weight results in an overall much sharper and more precise flight feel. But it also makes the copter fly less smoothly, since it is responding exactly to every little wiggle and jiggle of the stick. Lower D term setpoint weight results in a smoother, more &quot;organic feeling&quot; flight experience, but also a softer and less precise one. A very critical point to understand is that these characteristics ONLY come into play when the PID controller is responding to your stick movements. When the sticks are not moving, or are moving slowly, the effect is less pronounced or nonexistent, and the PID controller works exactly like it used to. So you can think of P, I, and D as tuning the overall response of the copter to all inputs, including external ones like wind blowing on the copter, and the setpoint weight sliders as tuning the way the copter responds specifically to stick movements. A video by Joshua about this (note: for 3.0):[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zncyYdAZPU] "},{"title":"V3.0.1​","type":1,"pageTitle":"BetaFlight 3.0 Release Notes","url":"/docs/release/BetaFlight-3.0.x#v301","content":"Dterm setpoint: 0 = Measurement, 1 = error. Everything above 1 is more error / more stick derivative. 2 = 2 times error. Second slider used to be P setpoint as originally described in 2DOF pid controllers and in release candidates, but I didn't find it as useful as I would like so it has been repurposed to be transition for the first slider. When going into the roll its error and when returning from roll back to center stick it will be transitioned more into measurement to smooth it out. Here it means D setpoint transition of 1 means no transition at all. Its fully error from setpoint weight. When lower than 1 it will soften the transition on returning stick slowly to measurement. For example if you liked the smoothness of measurement on quick stick inputs etc, but you also like the responsitivity of error, which makes it more robotic than you can find a middle way now. Still high stick response, but without losing the smoothness on stick returns. I personally fly 2.0 setpoint with 0.3 transition. 0.3 is like exponential curve on stick returns. It will help slow down the rotational rate faster instead at the last moment to prevent bumpyness. Not sure where new info on using the &quot;setpoint weight&quot; sliders and Tuning the newest BetaFlight PIDC (2DOF) should go but for now adding it here. These are Posts from people that have successfully used these to 'tune' out bad behavior.​ Maybe this should go into a New FAQ. Post in Boris' thread suggestions. General explanation from ctzsnooze:​ When flying through turbulent air the quad gets lots of external inputs. If the buffeting effect results in errors between your set roll rate and what the gyros report, then the PID system has to make corrections. Most PID systems 'under-correct' external influences simply because 'over-correction' will cause oscillation. When tuning, we aim to get the magnitude of the under-correction to be as small as possible. A very highly tuned quad sits just under the point of self-oscillation all the time. Mostly we don't tune as high as that because it won't tolerate dodgy props and we might get hot motors - however with the new filtering options we can sometimes up-tune without such a problem. I takes time to build up and let go. So when flying at medium speed through slightly bumpy air and noticing you have a 'wandering line', more I will usually help. But too much I may mean that once you leave one bank of moving air and enter the next, the accumulated iTerm correction will be going the opposite way and will take some time - about half a second - to 'let go'. So adding more iTerm won't always solve the problem. I certainly won't fix fast buffeting, it is too slow, and 'too much' I may not be helpful even for slow wandering lines. D on the other hand responds immediately to sudden changes, and responds faster as the buffeting becomes faster. It does very little or nothing for slow drifting behaviours (thats what I is for). P is good for any speed of buffeting but mostly when the angular deviations are larger, rather than small fast deviations for which D is more effective. If the quad is well tuned and has crisp roll stops, it should fly well in wind as well. If your filtering is heavy, the props are relatively heavy for the motors, and the quad already has issues in prop wash or with wobble, then it probably won't handle wind buffeting very well either. If you fly very fast through very turbulent air you need super responsive P and D and responsive lightweight props. The more 'aerodynamic' the quad the better. You may want to push P and D higher than 'normal', and maybe see if you can run with slightly higher filters - i.e. re-tune more aggressively. That tune might put you at risk of hotter motors or other oscillations and demand clean props, so it might not be your 'everyday' tune, but it should generally handle wind that little bit better than a less highly tuned machine. Post from QuadMcFly:​ Well I had an interesting experience trying to tune these silly 5x4.5x3HBN props on my primary acro quad. Mostly I just wanted to see if I could. The key ended up being kind of counter-intuitive. Basically I had to screw with the set-point sliders in 3.0.1 to compensate for the slow transition speed of the props, but it was exactly backwards from what I thought. The D set-point slider had to get put almost all the way to the left, and the Transition set-point slider all the way to the right, so essentially that basically equals almost the old &quot;measurement&quot; D calculation method. Then I was able to get my P gains back up to make up for the smoothing of the measurement method and get some snap back. I had to jack D way up too, to get rid of prop wash and it's still not gone entirely, but it's looking pretty darn good! Oh, also my I gains are quite high on both roll and pitch. I'm pretty pleased with the results! Still a tiny bit of prop wash at high throttle, but I think I can get rid of it with a tiny bit of TPA without sacrificing too much stick feel. Right now my TPA is at 0. Posts from the &quot;BB log video response&quot; thread by Woody_99:​ problem: Need just a little help with fine tuning a couple of my X quads. (130 and 250 size. BF 3.01) On a hard, high throttle 180 turn, I get some shaking on both of them. Been raising D, and it seems to be helping, but is that the direction I should be going? Motors aren't hot. From what I've been able to comprehend, that seems to be right, but wanted to double check that I'm on the right track.suggestion: Yes, raising 'D's should be correct to suppress prop wash as long as motors do not get hot. Do run a BB Log to check for oscillations and other bad things. ßF 3.0.x is still quite new but in Boris' thread there is discussion on the two sliders in the PID Tab. Seems adjusting these can really help eliminate prop wash and help a copter fly the best. Not many people have posted about these so not much is known on how to adjust them. Result: Raised D just a couple more points on both quads. Propwash was better, but still there. Instead or raising D any further, I thought I would give the top slider (Setpoint Weight) a try. 1st adjustment on the 130 and the propwash is totally gone at a Setpoint Weight of 2.36. 250 quad, I made the same 1st adjustment. Better still, but still slightly present. Made a second adjustment, and now the shakes are gone from the 2nd quad too. Setpoint Weight at 2.46. Both have the Setpoint transition at 0.3. Could be just a placebo effect, because I have no clue what the slider does, but both quads are better than ever. Motors are slightly above ambient temp, so I think I'm set. Wish I could say the same for my batteries. Flies so nice I was really pushing them today. Boris' comment of the Dterm Sliders:​ The sliders are pretty easy. Just use extremes and feel difference. Upper slider determines the stick sharpness (acceleration of stick input). The lower slider determines how smooth it acts on stick returns. Upper slider high: Sharpest response Lower slider high: sharpest response on stick returns, but also chance to most jerkiness. So smooth this out by higher transition deacceleration. Slider Tuning Tip from Tesseract1984:​ My freestyle setting was top slider down to 1.7 and bottom slider adjusted until bounceback is eliminated. I ended up with 0.8 (correction) Note: for my method, you quad needs to be well tuned already. No noise issues, minimal propwash (i have virtually zero since moving to dshot). If you don't sort your tune out first, you'll be chasing these sliders around trying to make sense of what it's actually doing to your tune. Tune first. Sliders last. This may be me speaking for myself and there might be a better method but this is what works for me. Oh, also, when you're tuning, don't be so afraid of using D. Keep jacking it up while maintaining motor temps until your prop wash is under control. My numbers ended up a lot higher in 3.1 over any other release. And Boris' reply: Yeah that's a valid statement. The sliders can even differ per prop. On bullnose props which seem a bit more bouncy in general I tend to run lower setpoint transition. On that way I don't have to sacrifice much sharpness on my tune. A Joshua Bardwell video on Betaflight 3.0 Setpoint Weight (2DOF PID Controller) MoreTuning Tip from Tesseract1984:​ Ya...I almost feel like there needs to be a blurb somewhere that post 3.0.1 you should rethink your paradigms around what are acceptable value ranges. I remember in 2.9.1 if i had D over 26 i had screwed up and usually meant starting from scratch. My D in 3.1 is now at 46 and 50 for R and P respectively and motors still come down cold. My P is also a lot higher than other releases on this same powertrain. I basically stopped pushing D up with my propwash handling was good. Yes lower the transition slider also helps with this if you are getting bounceback on move completion. So scenario 1: Propwash Crank the D, keeping an eye on motor tempsMotor temps high and still have propwash? Back off on P and try working D up again Scenario 2: Behaviour on stick return Play with slidersTransition slider specifically introduces some deceleration on stick return so that stops are not as abrupt.

BORIS - CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG !! pid_at_zero throttle kills PID's COMPLETELY for after you just arm. The moment you spool the motors up above zero, PID's start working. Now I'm not sure if they continue to work until you disarm or not I don't know, but as you see below, that doesn't matter. I think the motivation for this &quot;feature&quot; is to stop people whining about motors revving on the bench, or I dunno. For me, who run an underslung battery that barely lets the quad stand, I actually WANT pid at zero throttle, or it surely tips over when I arm it. Me, I need stabilization on the ground!! Airmode also has a threshold for starting, and again, the moment you come over this threshold, it is on until you disarm. Plus, airmode overrides &quot;Pid_at_zero_throttle&quot;. So even if &quot;pid_at_zero_throttle&quot; isn't sticky, airmode IS sticky, and since it overrides.... it makes pid_at_zero_throttle &quot;effectively sticky&quot;.

Explained by R.A.V. Here's an explanation for the new notch filter in 3.0 with the new PR in mind. Maybe waltr knows best where to put something from it into the wiki. From wikipedia: Quote: In signal processing, a band-stop filter or band-rejection filter is a filter that passes most frequencies unaltered, but attenuates those in a specific range to very low levels. It is the opposite of a band-pass filter. A notch filter is a band-stop filter with a narrow stopband (high Q factor). The pid loop calculates an error from the current gyro rate and a set point and will command the motors to correct this error. There is a limit to how fast motors can react and it makes no sense to try to correct anything at high frequencies above 200Hz. This is why the lowpass filter was introduced. It will leave most frequencies below the cutoff value intact but it will already attenuate the cutoff frequency by -3dB. The attenuation will increase with higher frequency. Unfortunately some setups are so noisy that the attenuation will not be enough and the filter cutoff has to be set very low to 70Hz or 60Hz simply to get rid of the noise above 200Hz. This means that useful information between cutoff and 100Hz is lost. A lower cutoff also means a higher delay caused by the filter which is especially bad for dTerm and can cause more propwash. The notch filter is an additional filter which can be enabled for gyro data and dTerm data and will remove a lot of noise from the signal before feeding it into the lowpass filter. This way the cutoff value of the lowpass filter does not need to be lowered too much. A notch filter with a low bandwidth in combination with a lowpass filter with high cutoff will have less delay and less noise than a lowpass filter alone with low cutoff. By default the filter is disabled. It will be enabled when the center frequency is set. This can be adjusted with gyro_notch_hz while the cutoff frequency at the lower side can be adjusted with gyro_notch_cutoff For dTerm the settings are dterm_notch_hz and dterm_notch_cutoff. Center frequency should be the mean frequency of your motors, most likely somewhere between 200Hz and 300Hz. When setting the cutoff value you should avoid getting the filter's range below 100Hz. Keep in mind that the attenuation at this frequency is already -3dB. My very noisy copter with mean motor frequency at 250Hz runs very well with these settings: gyro_notch_hz = 250 gyro_notch_cutoff = 130 dterm_notch_hz = 250 dterm_notch_cutoff = 130 gyro_lowpass = 110 dterm_lowpass = 0 yaw_lowpass = 0  This means that the notch filter will remove noise from gyro before the lowpass filter will improve the signal further. Because there is still some noise left in dTerm, another filter is needed. The notch filter alone is enough to remove the remaining noise in my case. It causes less latency than a lowpass filter and keeps the dTerm more in phase with pTerm. No filtering is required for yaw for my copter with filtered gyro. The notch filter requires some additional floating point math on each axis for gyro and dTerm so F1 targets might get slower with it enabled. In my opinion a properly setup notch filter can also help noise free copters, especially on dTerm. Without blackbox it will be very hard to determine the center motor frequency. I already looked into the current spectrum implementation of the viewer and will add an option to get the frequency easier. It does not need to be very precise though. I'd recommend to start with a center frequency of 200 - 250. Higher kv motors on 4s will create higher frequency noise than low kv on 3s. Cutoff describes the lower end of the filter response and should not be too low in order to reduce latency. I don't think anyone would need it to be lower than ~130.

But high D is not an issue at all if the motors dont heat up and if it all still sounds smooth. Thomas' Reply: Set dterm setpoint to 0 and no bounce back at all.

Betaflight is an open source project that is free to use and does not incur a license cost, however for the most successful release of a new flight controller or complete ready-to-fly product that is using Betaflight, it remains immensely beneficial to provide representative production samples or pre-production testing units to the Betaflight development team for testing and development feedback. In order to have hardware added to the Betaflight approved hardware list, hardware samples representative of the final configuration must be provided to designated members of the betaflight development team. It is strongly recommended that samples of development hardware or production-representative examples are evaluated positively before accepting pre-orders or releasing products. Many of the same benefits can be provided for inclusive hardware packages, including flight control stacks, or ready-to-fly craft. Sharing schematics/layouts with the reviewers will also be beneficial and improve the quality of the review. This provides the Betaflight team with an opportunity to ensure that the hardware and firmware behave 100% as expected in the representative configuration, as well as support verification of custom defaults required for firmware operation. After-sales support to customers from members of the Betaflight team are also made possible for reproducing end user issues. Additional benefits are also present in the form of allowing experienced active pilots with backgrounds in engineering of these systems to assist with aspects of the development process particularly in respect to real world use the products will be subjected to. Finally, we will offer a ’Betaflight approved’ product list on the Betaflight github to advise the userbase on electronics which both follow our ‘best practice’ guidance, and which have been tested by our development team. This will be available for flight controller hardware, as well as electronic speed controller stacks, AIOs, and ready-to-fly craft. This strategy is designed to help both developers optimise their hardware and our user base get directed to optimal hardware, and reduce support requests for the Betaflight team who serve a user base of over a hundred thousand users. 1 Important Terms and Conditions "},{"title":"1.1 Intent​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight Flight Controller Manufacturer Design Guidelines","url":"/docs/manufacturer/manufacturer-design-guidelines#11-intent","content":"The goal of achieving a certified hardware ecosystem for Betaflight Flight Controller hardware and firmware targets is to ensure that hardware design supports correct operation of Betaflight features and supports an improved user experience for ‘connecting’, flashing, programming, and flying.

Achieving state of the art performance requires minimizing latency in craft response to perturbations and command inputs, efficient filtering to remove oscillations from flight control calculations, and leveraging the capabilities of peripheral components to enhance the flight experience. For example, features such as advanced RPM filtering, RPM Dynamic Idle and Multi-Dynamic Notch rely on achieving microsecond scale timing jitter for best performance while simultaneously communicating with electronic speed controllers using bidirectional DShot, determining craft attitude and calculating optimal mixer outputs, as well as operating the myriad of desired user peripherals.

Similarly, physically larger components such as inverters in more protected locations from impacts or adjacent PCB boards in stacked build configurations is recommended. The commonly accepted and used board layouts include 16x16mm for M2 hardware (perpendicularly aligned), 25.4x25.4mm for M2 hardware (typically diagonally aligned), 20x20mm for M2 or M3 hardware (perpendicularly aligned), and 30.5x30.5mm for M3 hardware (perpendicularly aligned). In the case of 20x20 boards, selecting a hardware mounting size should be informed by the ability to use threaded inserts and shock-absorbing grommets in oversized holes, while dedicated M2 mounting limits mounting options if hardware is capable of being used in larger craft that tend to utilize M3 mounting. Boards with oversized holes (e.g. M4 holes and silicone inserts for M3 stack mounting) experience longer service life and experience fewer failures due to PCB deformation during impacts. For standalone flight controllers, integrated ‘AIO’ flight controllers, and even adjacent configurations provided as ‘stacks’ with additional PCBs, this architecture has been proven to be the most robust over time. Board layouts should provide redundancy for all critical functions. For example, solder locations with identical pin arrangements to JST connector located adjacent to the JST header mounting is strongly recommended, providing end users significant added value and opportunities to produce more robust craft. Castellations and use of mounting pads with through holes or edge continuity are also strongly recommended, especially with more compact flight controller designs. For board layouts implementing transistor PINIO functionality for ‘pit switch’ or similar behaviors, solder bridge options are strongly recommended to enable users to select output voltage, or physically bypass the switching functionality by connecting to voltage sources. Particularly for video systems, it is strongly recommended to avoid performing this switching on the ground, due to interference concerns demonstrated with inconsistent ground planes. If providing direct mounting support for receivers, the following specification should be followed: the pin sequence must be GND, 5V, UART RX, UART TX with a 2.54mm pin pitch, and permit receivers sized up to 12x20mm. This mirrors the standard mounting (Gnd/5V/Tx/Rx) of CRSF Nano and ELRS Nano receivers, with mirrored UART communication allowing for Tx and Rx to be paired to the same UART. Rules: GND should be as close to a signal as possible.High speed signals should be away from power.Keep similar signals next to each other.Always minimize current flow path. info For connector pinout please refer to the Betaflight Connector Standard "},{"title":"3.1.2 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Selection​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight Flight Controller Manufacturer Design Guidelines","url":"/docs/manufacturer/manufacturer-design-guidelines#312-inertial-measurement-unit-imu-selection","content":"Selecting an appropriate IMU for flight controller operation is critical to the resulting flight performance of systems.

In cases such as the ICM-42688-P, ICM-42688-V, or ICM-42605, early hardware validation samples should be explored in collaboration with Betaflight developers to determine the suitability of these IMU units in relevant environments. The ability to customize IMU lowpass filtering and operate within the same GRMS/Shock environment allows for maximum portability of existing filtering and tune schemes, but this development must occur with complete hardware samples and flown in representative flight regimes in order to replicate the EMI environment end users will experience. The IMU sensors, designed for applications outside of sUAS, are typically subjected to very harsh electromagnetic environments. Ensuring electromagnetic compatibility when using these immediately adjacent to ultrasonically switched power MOSFET devices, constantly operational radio frequency devices (such as remote control and FPV video systems), under thermal stresses of moving over 1kW through the complete flight stack, are a nontrivial operation. In order to minimize risks of flyaway and brownout behaviors which can be observed if IMU data filtering and power delivery are inadequate, proper circuit design and validation testing must be performed.

Providing robust low-ripple power to these devices provides the maximum performance potential and hardware longevity for operation in the challenging EMI environments present on these craft. Similarly, 3.3V, 5V, and 9-12V BEC power needs to provide consistent power at the intended current draw. For example, 3.3V 500mA is a recommended minimum current. ‘4.5V’ (5V USB supplied power) should be capable of powering a receiver and GPS unit, which may require over 700mA. Standard battery powered 5V rails should provide at least 1A, preferably 1.5A to 2A in order to provide higher current if anticipated to be used with a large number of peripherals (such as LED strips, 5V powered FPV Video Systems, or as source power to HD cameras). Providing a 10V 2A BEC is also strongly recommended with flight controller designs, as this supports high definition video systems, and even enables better analog video system power options. Each of these can be optionally connected to PINIO driven pit switches, and/or jumper pad setups that enable end users to select constant-on or transistor switched behavior, particularly if located to support video transmission systems. Such 10V regulators should function at full rated current down to 10V input voltage to support the BEC output from some ESCs. Again, providing robust low-ripple power to these devices provides the maximum performance potential and hardware longevity for operation in the challenging EMI environments present on these craft. 3.1.4.2 ADC Circuitry (e.g. for Current Sensors)​ Using ADC measurements on the flight controller to actively monitor current information from ESCs, or if using integral FC-PDB, minimizing noise on the circuit improves the accuracy and jitter of these signals. To reduce noise from current reading, instead of transfering voltage to FC, send current to FC then move RL Load resistor associated with INA31 onto FC with capacitor in parallel.https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina139.pdf Ideally there should be a pair of bridgeable pads on the ESC in series with the load resistor so that with legacy FCs one can bridge it to include the resistor. Correspondingly on FCs we should have a 82K resistor (and parallel 100nF cap), again with series bridging pads which would be left unbridged when paired with legacy ESCs. When using an ESC/FC stack supporting the above bridging pads, one would leave the ESC pads open and short those on the FC for noise free current reading. In all other cases the ESC pads would be bridged or the FC’s left open to support the current configuration at the expense of higher noise. Note that the above recommendation is based on the fact that if current if fed into one end of a wire, that same current will always flow out of the other end, whereas with a voltage there will be a voltage drop due to resistance in both that wire and the ground return, and the currents flowing through them. Converting the current to a voltage at the input of the ADC will result in significant noise reduction. 3.1.4.3 Supporting Additional Features​ Numerous standard features have become common with flight controller design, for example chips such as MAX7456 to enable monochrome On-Screen Display (OSD) functionality, including Barometers to supplement IMU functionality to provide more accurate altitude estimates, PINIO transistor switched output pads, LED pads, or additional PWM/Motor outputs. In order to fully support these additional features, it remains strongly recommended that hardware manufacturers incorporate early developer feedback to ensure complete functionality. 3.1.4.4 SWD Debug Support​ In order to aid development of Betaflight firmware, and to debug FC specific issues, it is highly beneficial to have test points for the SWDIO/SWCLK lines together with 3V3 and ground connections to enable connection of a debugger such as a Segger JLink or ST-Link. This speeds up resolution of issues hugely, so if at all possible do not use those pins (PA13/PA14) for other purposes. 3.1.4.5 Blackbox Support​ Black box of at least 8mb should also be standard on all fcs as it’s literally impossible to problem solve a tune or flight issues with out black box. 3.1.4.6 LEDs​ FCs should implement at least one LED to indicate activity. The second is preferable, and the third optional. Having at least one LED is essential for users to help diagnose basic faults. More LEDs are beneficial to developers as we can build custom images to help diagnose user reported issues. Each LED should be connected to a GPIO line. Polarity of the output does not matter.

They also do not exhibit the SPI 1 DMA limitations of F4 processors. Bitbang Dshot communcation protocol will always use Timer 1 and Timer 8 - Do NOT use these timers for any other functions 3.2.1.3 F4 Resource Selection​ Due to F4 MCU management of serial inversion, any pins that implement inversion should be clearly marked, and ideally not result in reduced capability of that UART when used with un-inverted peripheral connections. For Betaflight 4.4 and later versions, the expected default configuration will take advantage of Bidirectional DShot, therefore default Looprates and DShot of 8k/4k/DShot-300 are anticipated to be the stock configuration. This does specifically require Motor Resource allocation to enable proper bidirectional DShot communication. If using Bitbang DShot, when SPI Bus #1 is to be used for the gyro, care must be taken to ensure that motor pins are assigned to appropriate timers. This is because Bitbang DSHOT uses DMA2 to write to GPIO ports. If this is enabled, it is not possible to enable DMA on an SPI bus using DMA2. Practically speaking this means that we can’t support DMA on SPI bus 1 (which uses DMA2) on F405 and F411 processors. It is better to put multiple devices on other SPI busses that use SPI bus 1, which is typically used for the gyro. Bitbang Dshot communcation protocol will always use Timer 1 and Timer 8 - do NOT use these pins for any other functions.

Practically, this means that all pins should be on the same port, or at most two ports, so that only one (or two) DMA streams are required for bitbanged operation. Additional Recommendations: Use A00 for LED Strip (diatone fury resources insert as example) Use pins PA13 and 14 for debug options. Including test point pads (these can by tiny) as well as the necessary 3.3v/Ground pads is strongly recommended. The DIAT-FURYF4OSD is a good example configuration for F405 boards, because it uses pins with timers that do not experience any conflicts. Motors are on port pins with associated timers and use neither TIM 1 nor N Channels.

When creating flight controller revisions and improvements, it is strongly recommended that indications and documentations are made available, particularly when pinout changes, output rating changes, or hardware bill of material changes. Any board configuration change requiring a user to change configuration behavior must have an accompanying change in marking to indicate (e.g. changing an IMU, or altering the pinout of solder pads). Following standard marking practices (e.g. V, VCC, or VBAT for battery voltage, G or GND for ground, T for ESC Telemetry, C for Current Sensing ADC, etc.) is also strongly recommended. Similarly, providing consistent color selections for pin header JST wiring looms, and consistent marking on the PCB is always preferable for robust building and troubleshooting. Providing a CLI dump file that enables users to reset their flight controller to stock configuration is needed if a dedicated target is not provided.

Developing an Official Betaflight preset and generating a pull request with the assistance of the Betaflight development team allows for end users to quickly and easily configure their craft. The versatility of selectable options, RC Link presets, and even Tune &amp; Filter presets allow for diverse configurations of RTF craft products to be supported. Applying and using presets not only saves users significant time, but reduces the likelihood of data entry errors or incorrect configurations to be applied, which can be of particular importance for products aimed at less experienced users. For manufacturers providing configuration presets for flight controllers (strongly recommended), providing documentation of suggested locations to connect peripheral devices, match the provided preset menu selections can greatly assist end users with proper configuration of their craft. These should include selecting appropriate PID loop rates, DShot data rates, IMU-specific Gyro Lowpass Filtering, Receiver installation (including options with the correct Port, protocol, SerialRX_Inversion, and SerialRX_HalfDuplex), HD FPV MSP port installation, VTX control (including protocol(s), port, and optional pit mode states), GPS (port and protocols), LEDs, and any PINIO type peripheral connections where applicable. Working with the Betaflight development team provides opportunities to develop presets that can bring RTF craft back to stock configuration, enable users to rapidly configure ‘Plug &amp; Play’ systems based on selected RC link hardware installed per documentation, and even permit Betaflight developers with extensive experience developing precise tunes for craft to generate a range of tunes for that specific product.

Don't run 8k on F3 processors, use 4/4 on those. F4 / F7 should run fine on higher freq. mjbudden posted on Boris' thread regarding the gyro/PID loop speed and Dynamic Filtering: Official recommendation from myself and r.a.v. (who between us wrote the code) is not to use above 4k/4k on F3 processors if using dynamic filtering. When running 8k gyro you have 125 microseconds in each loop and it is simply not enough time to run the calculations. So the PID loop will run slower than 8k anyway. There may be no outward signs of problems, but there will be jitter in the PID loops and that can potentially cause problems. "},{"title":"Crash Recovery​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 3.2 Release Notes","url":"/docs/release/BetaFlight-3.2#crash-recovery","content":"TO DO - fill in CLI commands and what they do. Briefly the mode works like this: A crash is detected if crash_dthreshold and crash_gthreshold are exceded.Once a crash is detected, the craft tries to level itself, ignoring RC input on roll and pitch axes.Craft continues to try and level itself until either:crash_time milliseconds after the crash, orthe craft angle is less than crash_recovery_angle degrees on both the roll and pitch axes and the craft gyro rate is less that crash_recovery_rate degrees/second on both roll and pitch axes.For testing purposes crash recovery can be enabled by turning the beeper on (this will be removed/changed if crash recovery proves successful). TCHTHSKY Posted in Boris' thread-Here's the code for it. It has comments: And here is the feature request: And here's this: Here's another from earlier in this thread: Important note from mjbudden:​ The crash recovery routine does not currently attempt to limit yaw spin - it just tried to level the quad. I did not anticipate the &quot;yaw spin to the moon&quot; problem when I wrote the crash recovery routine. I'm now working on a solution. See PR github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/3909 in github for the current discussion on the subject. Feel free to contribute to the discussion. Also black box logs of &quot;yaw spins to the moon&quot; are very welcome and will help analyze and solve the problem. From Yamaford: Just to clear this up for others that may read this wrong, I don't think your crash recovery code is the culprit as the crazy &quot;YSTTM&quot; (Yaw spin to the moon) is happening with or without acc or crash recovery enabled right? From mjbudden: Correct. Yaw spin to the moon happens with or without crash recovery enabled and is not cause by crash recovery code. There is a new PR that tries to fix this, see PR 3909. If you could test this and provide blackbox logs it would be most useful. Crash Recovery while failsafe is active​ In the event that a crash is detected while the vehicle is in failsafe mode, it will immediately disarm. This is to prevent damage or injury should the vehicle strike an object or the ground during a failsafe event (i.e. loss of RX signal). This should also disarm the vehicle after failsafe LANDING has put the vehicle on the ground. Once the failsafe condition has cleared (i.e. RX signal is restored for a minimum of 30 seconds), the vehicle will once again be ready to arm. "},{"title":"\"flip after crash mode\" (was called Turtle Mode)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 3.2 Release Notes","url":"/docs/release/BetaFlight-3.2#flip-after-crash-mode-was-called-turtle-mode","content":"TO DO - Describe what this does, how to setup and which ESC firmware supports this. NOTE: Ensure the ESC Firmware supports DSHOT commands to Reverse the motors. NOT all latest ESC firmware has this support. Check with the ESC Firmware developers/Docs for the ESCs you are using.​ Description by brycej: In its current form (as of last week, 8aug17, or so). You need to flick the mode switch and then arm. Throttle and yaw sticks don't do anything. Pitch and roll will control which props are spinning based on stick deflection. With the pitch and roll centered no props are moving. Take a good guess on the side with free props and try and flip it over. If it isn't flipping, try a different pitch or roll. Don't just jam the stick over and leave it if it is stuck. I haven't burned up any escs in quite a bit of testing, but I'm just someone will manage it with some effort.... Disarm after flipped. Undo flipaftercrash mode and rearm to fly away. Other tips: Has worked well to get me out of trees. Try it with props off on the bench first. 16.63 from official blheli hasn't some issues reversing all the motors because it is a little more stringent then 16.67 from the unofficial blheli fork. Newer betaflight versions have some fixes in to help that. Also, try it in short grass LOS so you can see how it works... Can't fix broken props or save you or if long grass, so doesn't always work. RCs 4 or below inverted the mixer and had all 4 props reversed and spinning. That works too but it is a little more messy on the ground and requires some finesse. "},{"title":"Yaw Jump tuning​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 3.2 Release Notes","url":"/docs/release/BetaFlight-3.2#yaw-jump-tuning","content":"Post by ctzsnooze: The jump up when abruptly stopping / reversing a hard yaw spin is because two motors must go full on to generate maximum yaw torque. That's like applying 50% throttle. acc_limit_yaw delays the speed at which yaw can accumulate, but not the maximum amount, so as you say it kind of delays the onset of the jump, but if a big correction is needed it will still jump at the same speed. As you say, slowing the rate of onset of yaw moves using a lower acc_limit_yaw will reduce yaw responsiveness to stick inputs. pid_sum_yaw indirectly limits the maximum speed the motors will be requested to attain during a yaw move. That will limit the maximum possible yaw rate, and reduce the climb rate to the same extent. Basically jump and yaw are inextricably linked. But this should retain crisp yaw responsiveness for inputs that don't hit the limit. RC5 has a number of measures to reduce yaw spin to the moon problems. I haven't had a bad one since going to RC5. Reversing the prop rotation also seems to me to reduce the amount of spin acquired when clipping a gate with the outside of a front prop. This reduces the chance of getting a big spin and a big climb after hitting a gate. Keep in mind that if you clip a gate and spin at high rotational rates, and if you run a lot of yaw P, two of your motors will go full on to oppose that spin, and may need to stay on for some time before regaining control. I configure my sticks so that equal yaw and roll stick deflections result in a properly banked turn with the quad at 45 degrees. Hence I set the same rates for yaw as for roll. However because yaw responsiveness is inherently weaker than roll, I do need to run quite a lot of yaw P, which does cause fast yaw climbs after clipping gates.

These changes have been added to Betaflight configurator 10.3.1 (installation instructions here). Please update your Betaflight configurator to version 10.3.1. If you are using the Blackbox Log Viewer, there is an updated version 3.1.0 to go with Betaflight 3.4 (installation instructions here);as part of the overhaul of the various filter stages, and improvements to the PID loop, the default settings have been re-evaluated and updated. The new default values are designed to make optimal use of the new filtering and improved PID loop, and be flyable with (almost) any hardware. Even if your current set up is working ok, it is probably worthwhile to try and only restore the non-filtering / PID loop settings, and have a go with the new default values (store your old diff in a safe place, just in case you don't like the new values 😉). (#6036);also as part of the filtering overhaul, the names of the debug modes available to log filtering / tuning data have been improved NOTCH (gyro data after scaling, before filtering) is now GYRO_SCALED, GYRO (gyro data after all filtering has been applied) is now GYRO_FILTERED (#6059);the upper limit of dterm_setpoint_weight has been increased to 2000 (corresponding to a value of 20 for 'D Setpoint Weight' in Betaflight configurator). This means that pilots wanting a more 'locked in' stick feeling can increase this value beyond the previous maximum of 254. At the same time, an undocumented scaling change was reverted, and the scale is now again how it is described in the Betaflight configurator. If you are using a custom setting for dterm_setpoint_weight, divide your value by 1.27 to get the new value that will give you the same feeling as between 3.1.6 and 3.4.0 (#5945, #6052);Dshot beacon configuraton has been changed. Now the beacon CLI command can be used analogous to how the beeper command is used. This allows for the Dshot beacon to be disabled individually for the conditions that are supported by it (RX_SET and RX_LOST at the moment). The old way of disabling the Dshot beacon by setting beeper_dshot_beacon_tone to 0 is no longer supported. The Dshot beacon is disabled for all conditions by default, if you want to enable it, use beacon &lt;condition name|ALL&gt; in CLI (#5891, #6070);in previous versions of the firmware, there was a race condition that could cause Dshot commands (e.g. activation of crash flip) to be ignored by the ESC when the Dshot beacon was active. To prevent this, a timeout has been added to the Dshot beacon that prevents arming for 1.2 seconds after the Dshot beacon was active (#6079);validation has been added for the RSSI configuration. Unlike in previous versions, it is no longer possible to have multiple sources for RSSI configured simultaneously, since only one can be active at any one time. If you have got more than one of the supported RSSI sources (frame error count / ADC / RX channel) configured, all but the first on this list will be disabled (#5644);scaling has been added to all RSSI sources. If the RSSI mechanism that you are using does not give you the output range that you want for RSSI, you can now use the rssi_scale / rssi_offset CLI variables to set the scale and offset for RSSI (#6001, #6032);the functionality of the crash flip mode has been improved: In addition to the existing front / back / left / right spinning of 2 propellers, it now supports spinning only 1 propeller (by moving the roll / pitch stick diagonally), and spinning 2 props that are diagonally opposite (by moving yaw), in order to yaw the overturned craft. The largest stick deflection in any of these directions determines which properllers are spun (#5163);the setting moron_threshold for the acceptable noise limit during gyro calibration was renamed to gyro_calib_noise_limit. Additionally, a new setting gyro_calib_duration was added. This allows users to configure a longer minimum gyro calibration duration (in 1/10ths of seconds, default: 125). Using a larger setting here will result in reduced gyro drift, which is helpful when flying line of sight (#5932);unfortunately bugfixes and improvements in the flight controller core functionality have led to an increase of the firmware size, causing it to overflow the available space on a number of F3 based flight controllers. As a result, some features have had to be removed from a number of F3 based flight controllers in order to make the firmware fit into flash. The following targets are affected: BETAFLIGHTF3, COLIBRI_RACE, FRSKYF3, FURYF3OSD, LUX_RACE, MIDELICF3, OMNIBUS, RCEXPLORERF3, RG_SSD_F3, SPRACINGF3EVO, SPRACINGF3NEO;the OSD elements osd_crosshairs (crosshairs) and osd_ah_sbar (artificial horizon sidebar) have been renamed in CLI to osd_crosshairs_pos and osd_ah_sbar_pos to make them consistent with the naming of OSD elements.

Setting vtx_band = 0 allows users of VTX using the SmartPort or Tramp protocols to set the desired frequency directly via the vtx_freq parameter. Since direct frequency setting is not supported by the RTC6705 (onboard) VTX driver vtx_band = 0 does not work for these VTX, and should not be used (#5465).

Use them, or use the new tuning sliders in the Betaflight configurator 10.6.0 to get your craft tuned. Please do not paste tuning configurations from previous versions of the firmware. Some defaults have been changed, and some parameters are used in different ways, so previous tuning settings will not work well with Betaflight 4.1 (#8623, #8736);with the introduction of fully configurable VTX control (VTX tables), after flashing the firmware you now have to load a VTX tables appropriate for your VTX and for the country you are flying in before you can control your VTX through Betaflight.

Please update to at least this version;if you are using OpenTX and the Betaflight TX Lua scripts, please update them to at least version 1.2.0 in order to get support for the latest features introduced in Betaflight 4.0;there are a number of flight performance related improvements in Betaflight 4.0. Therefore, pasting back-ups of the tuning settings for older versions of Betaflight into Betaflight 4.0 will most likely result in poor flight performance! The default settings in Betaflight 4.0 should be reasonably well flyable for most hardware configurations, but users wanting to tune the performance of their craft should read the 4.0 Tuning Notes to learn everything they need to know about tuning Betaflight 4.0 (#6432, #6943, #7078, #7264, #7271, #7304, #7373, #7538);there was a fix to how the min_check 'zero throttle' dead zone is applied. Before the fix, there was an additional, undocumented deadband of the same size as the min_check range above the min_check range. The fix has not brought a change to the arming behaviour and throttle is still required to be below min_check for arming to be possible. However the extra unintended throttle deadband above min_check has been eliminated. This will result in more responsive throttle near minimum and a slight increase in throttle resolution. If you desire to retain the same range for the 'zero throttle' dead zone, you need to double the amount of dead zone configured in min_check (offset from 1000). Be aware that this will also double the throttle range within which the craft can be armed (#7463);there is a new 'Stick Overlay' OSD element that shows an overlay of the current stick positions. In order to use it, the font loaded onto the OSD needs to be updated to the latest version (available in configurator 10.5.0 or newer) (#7476);the functionality of the 'crash flip arrow' OSD element was extended to activate as well when the craft is not in crash flip mode, but small_angle is set, and the craft is unarmed and tilted more than small_angle. This is to show pilots that they won't be able to arm from the current orientation, and allow them to activate crash flip mode and then right their craft (#7250);As part of the introduction of Unified Targets, the existing resource command was complemented with two new commands for resource management: timer and dma. Just like resource can be used to assign pins to functions, timer can be used to assign timers to pins, and dma can be used to assign DMA streams to subsystems and pins (if they have a timer assigned). Important: Since DMA streams are linked to pins through timers, timer assignments for pins have to be made first, before dma assignments to these pins can be made (#5824, #6837, #7620);The syntax for the resource, timer, and dma commands was consolidated, and as part of this the resource list subcommand was renamed into resource show. This aligns it with the new dma show and timer show subcommands (#7712);the following parameters were renamed to more closely match their function: p_level =&gt; angle_level_strength, i_level =&gt; horizon_level_strength, d_level =&gt; horizon_transition (#6673);the gyro configuration was unified from being done by gyro hardware model to being generic for all gyro models. This means that for some targets that are used for multiple different boards that come with different gyro models that are mounted with different orientations, it is necessary from Betaflight 4.0 on to manually set gyro_1_sensor_align (and / or gyro_2_sensor_align for boards with a second gyro) to match the gyro orientation on the board that is used. See note #6761 for an explanation, and instructions for individual boards. This is a temporary workaround, per-board configurations with correct gyro alignment will be released as Unified Target configurations (#5868);unfortunately, bugfixes in the flight controller core functionality have led to an increase of the firmware size, causing it to overflow the available space on almost all F3 based flight controllers. As a result, features have had to be removed from all but a few of the currently supported F3 based flight controllers. Some of the affected targets are: AIORACERF3, BETAFLIGHTF3, CHEBUZZF3, CRAZYBEEF3FR, FURYF3, FURYF3OSD, IMPULSERCF3, LUX_RACE, LUXV2_RACE, MIDELICF3, OMNIBUS, RACEBASE, RMDO, SIRINFPV, SPRACINGF3, SPRACINGF3MINI, SPRACINGF3NEO, STM32F3DISCOVERY (#6900, #6955, #7037, #7038, #7045, #7306, #7381, #7392, #7402, #7421, #7501, #7508, #7518, #7829, #7842);in addition to the above point, the following features had to be removed from all F3 based flight controllers in order to make the firmware fit into flash: Smart Feedforward, support for flashing / configuration of SimonK based ESCs (#7272, #7274, #7391);support for status display through LED strips was removed from F3 based flight controllers, in order to be able to reclaim some flash space. In its place, LED Strip Profiles (except for the 'Status' profile which is not supported on F3) can be used to set LED strips to fixed colours. LED strip profiles are also available on F4 / F7, to enable simple configuration of the LED strip in OSD (#7485);since the above three measures proved to be insufficient to keep flash space from overflowing on F3 based flight controllers, a system of classifying F3 based flight controllers into a number of 'feature cut' levels, and removing features according from them according to their level were introduced. This was used to reduce the number of features built into most F3 based flight controllers even more (#7429).

Some defaults have been changed, and some parameters are used in different ways, so previous tuning settings will not work well with Betaflight 4.1 (#8623, #8736);after installing new firmware or resetting the configuration, the motor output protocol selected by default is now 'disabled'. This means that the correct motor protocol has to be selected before the craft can be armed. But this also removed the limitation on the maximum possible PID loop speed imposed by the pre-selected legacy protocol (OneShot125) in earlier versions, resulting in the maximum possible PID loop speed for each MCU type being pre-selected. Arming will be disabled and a warning displayed in configurator until a motor output protocol has been selected (#9619);when enabling bidirectional Dshot, the maximum possible PID loop speed for Dshot protocols will be reduced by half to accommodate for the time taken by the ESC to send the RPM data packet to the flight controller. This does not affect Dshot600, but if bidirectional Dshot is used with Dshot300, the maximum PID loop speed is 4 kHz, and 2 kHz for Dshot150 (#9642);the threshold for activation of the yaw spin recovery feature has had an automatic mode added - this mode sets the threshold to a value that is based on the currently configured maximum yaw rate, with a buffer added on top of it. This new mode is the default for yaw spin threshold, since it provides a setting that is safe to use for most users. Manual configuration of the yaw spin threshold is still possible (#9455);accelerometer calibration is now required before arming is allowed if any feature is enabled that requires the accelerometer. This is to prevent situations arising where the craft may try to self-level with an uncalibrated accelerometer, leading to unexpected or dangerous results. Arming will be disabled and a warning displayed in configurator until the accelerometer has been calibrated (#9031);the calculation for the virtual current meter device has been changed to be based on the throttle value used in the mixer, instead of the throttle channel RC input. This means that this value has things like throttle limiting and throttle boost applied, resulting in more accurate prediction of current and consumption. If you are using the virtual current meter device, make sure to calibrate it again after updating the firmware to make sure the calibration is still correct (#9153);the way that the 'RSSI dBm' value is tracked in the firmware has changed to use actual dBM value in a range of -130 to 0, instead of the previous version's 130 to 0 range. This means that if a custom setting for osd_rssi_dbm_alarm is used, this will have to be changed to be the inversion of its previous value (e.g. 60 becomes -60) (#9550);since stick arming is not recommended for multirotor craft because it can lead to accidental disarms, it has been disabled by default. If you want to use stick arming (at your own risk), it has to be enabled by setting enable_stick_arming to on (#9183);the name CLI command has been removed.

HD OSD​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 4.4 Release Notes","url":"/docs/release/Betaflight-4.4-Release-Notes#2-hd-osd","content":"HD OSD is now supported and adds the following features. Note that not all HD Goggle/VTX combinations support all features, but hopefully will do so in time. If the OSD option alone, or the OSD (HD) option is included in the build options, then HD support will be included. To enable HD support select VTX (MSP + Displayport) on the ports tab for the UART to which the VTX is connected. The MSP option will automatically be selected.  The OSD HD preview may be manually selected on the OSD tab along side the PAL and NTSC options however this is not necessary as the first time the HD Goggle/VTX system is powered the FC detects it and automatically applies the following settings, saves and reboots automatically. This only happens if the setting below are not already applied. This is a new feature, and may not be supported by the your HD system yet, so if the OSD tab does not automatically switch to HD, please enter the commands below manually. set osd_displayport_device = MSP set vcd_video_system = HD  The size of the canvas (visible number of columns/rows) defaults to 53x20 (compared to 30x16 for PAL and 30x13 for NTSC). The VTX is then able to adjust this by sending an MSP command to adjust the canvas size. WTFOS will set this to 60x22 for example. This will be automatic with no user interaction required. Should the goggle vendor decide to support alternate canvas sizes then they would be selected in the goggle menus, and the new canvas size communicated to Betaflight which would then adjust the usable number of OSD rows/columns accordingly. Regardless of the canvas size the boot logo, armed message, stats, CMS menu etc. will be centred correctly. If the canvas size is reduced, either by selecting the PAL/NTSC options or by the VTX sending a different canvas size, all OSD elements will be moved onto the available canvas so they can be repositioned using the configurator. In addition to the usual OSD elements it is now possible, where supported by the Goggle/VTX vendor, to enable/disable and reposition the following OSD elements. If none are explicitly enabled then all those supported will be displayed at their default locations. Goggle battery voltageVTX voltageBit-rateDelayDistanceVideo link qualityGoggle DVR iconVTX DVR iconVTX warningsVTX temperatureGoggle fan speed To make better use of the colour OSD capabilities of the HD systems, four fonts are now supported. The intent is that these be used to display text and other icons in white, green, amber and red corresponding to normal, good, marginal, critical conditions respectively. This will allow the link quality text and icon to be display in red when critical, amber when marginal, and green when good for example. To enable this feature set the displayport_msp_fonts array to select the font number (0-4) to use for each of normal, good, marginal, critical conditions respectively. To enable all four fonts: set displayport_msp_fonts = 0,1,2,3  To only use the the default (predominantly white) font: set displayport_msp_fonts = 0,0,0,0  To display critial warnings in red, select the first font for normal, good, and marginal OSD elements and for critical OSD elements select the third font: set displayport_msp_fonts = 0,0,0,3  Thanks goes to @SteveCEvans for these improvements!

GPS Return to Home Enhancements​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 4.4 Release Notes","url":"/docs/release/Betaflight-4.4-Release-Notes#4-gps-return-to-home-enhancements","content":"GPS &quot;Rescue&quot; has been extensively revised and greatly improved. The quad should reliably return at the set speed, descend at an angle, land within a few metres of the home point, and disarm automatically on touch-down. There are separate PID control elements for altitude and return velocity t home; the defaults work very well for 'typical' quads. The system should initially be tested with a switch at reasonably close range and low altitude. Setting up and testing GPS Rescue to provide a reliable return on the event of an RxLoss failsafe is a non-trivial task, but well worth the trouble. We strongly recommend reading the wiki entry and following the instructions there. Remember that in any true failsafe the quad will always enter Failsafe Stage 1 phase for 1s (user-configurable) before initiating the Rescue. You MUST set the Stage 1 behaviour NOT to DROP, or it will disarm and drop in Stage 1 and never enter GPS Rescue. The safest option for Stage 1 is to configure Angle Mode on an aux switch, and set Stage 1 Failsafe to enable Angle Mode at a fixed hover / light climb throttle value with all other sticks forced to center. When you get signal loss of more than 300ms, you'll enter Angle Mode, and the will start to level out. That will give you a clear advance warning that you are getting signal breakup. Alternatively, you can set Failsafe Stage 1 to hold all current values; the quad will then continue on the same path until Stage 1 Failsafe expires and the Rescue starts. Please disable the compass/magnetometer unless: it has been fully calibrated, andyou have confirmed, by logging, that the magnetometer heading values are noise free and reflect the true attitude of the quad. In most short flights, using the Baro provides a significant improvement in altitude control. Baro data is updated more frequently than GPS data, and often varies less. The user can control how much trust they place on the Baro vs GPS altitude data. Over long flights, and with some particular Baro units or installations, Baro drift can be more of a problem, and the GPS data should be trusted more. There are three new, and very useful, GPS Rescue Debug modes. One shows how accurately the quad tracks the requested altitude and the requested velocity. The other two are used for tuning the GPS Rescue PIDs. If Mag is enabled, Mag information is automatically recorded. Data acquisition from GPS hardware now uses the UBlox protocol, at 10hz, by default. NMEA mode has been improved and in some cases will run at 10hz. We now can log Dilution Of Precision values for future improvements. There are extensive changes to sanity checks, and in most cases the quad will attempt to land itself, rather than disarm, if necessary using only the Baro signal. WARNING: ALWAYS CHECK that the Home Arrow points directly back towards home after takeoff! Sometimes, if you take off and spin around during arming, or immediately on takeoff, the quad's attitude information can become corrupted, and the Home Arrow can point the wrong way. It's best to arm cleanly and fly away from Home in a straight line at reasonable speed immediately after takeoff. Watch the Home Arrow carefully to ensure that it quickly points back to Home. If the Home Arrow points the wrong way when a failsafe occurs, the GPS Rescue will initially fly off in the wrong direction and in some cases you may lose the quad. thanks to @ctzsnooze, @karatebrot, @haslinghuis "},{"title":"5.

A PT2 filter is used at 6Hz by default. The value can be tweaked to focus the boost when it is needed most by changing the anti_gravity_cutoff value. Higher values will make the boost a bit stronger but of shorter duration. Lower values may work better for less responsive builds or where a more prolonged boost is needed.applying iTerm windup constraints to antigravity-induced iTerm increases (thanks tbolin)removing the old 'step' mode, which wasn't working as intended The AntiGravity value is now directly related to the amount of iTerm boost. The default is now 80, meaning 8x iTerm boost on fast throttle cuts.Do not increase AntiGravity unless you've made a log and confirm that there is no P wobble. Use the debug.See PR#11679 for more information - thanks @ctzsnooze, @tbolin. iTermWindup iTermWindup is an 'old' way to prevent iTerm growth when the quad cannot achieve the requested target rate. In 4.4 we are making iTermWindup active by default, at a value of 85. Whenever the motorMix percentage exceeds the iterm_windup limit value of 85%, iTerm growth will be reduced to the extent that motor_mix exceeds the iterm_windup value. There will be zero iTerm growth only when motorMix differential is 100%. The iTerm inhibiotion will apply on all axes, including yaw. The default value is appropriate for nearly all quads. Heavy or very low authority quads with significant iTerm windup problems (slow oscillations on larger moves) may benefit from lower iterm_windup values. iTermWindup complements iTermRelax, and is especially useful to prevent iterm windup in low authority quads where the machine is not able to meet the target rate for some time after the sticks have stopped moving. iTermRelax is most effective, and operates more smoothly, when the sticks are moving fast. iTermWindup also constrains iTerm growth in a variety of impact or failure states.

Smoother mixer throttle adjustment with extreme stick inputs or gyro rates There were a number of edge cases where the onset of airmode throttle boost was not smooth, with different outcomes depending on the mixer type.

Setpoint transition has been disabled (1.0) to give more linearity over the entire stick. I still recommend that you slowly remove default filtering as well if your setup allows you for best results. Nowadays most do softmounting so removing of filters can easily improve performance. The defaults are optimized for hard mounted medium noisy environment for safety. The best tuning performance is achieved with as less Du. See the Gyro &amp; Filters for much more. Air mode feature and failsafe issue​ This is with regards to the issue raised in RCGroups (https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=37535627&amp;postcount=48369) and in issue #3108 (https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues/3108). The issue that was being faced was due to misconfiguration of the failsafe function, specifically failsafe stage 2 had been disabled. It is failsafe stage 2 that is responsible for putting the craft into a safe state after a failure, stage 1 is still regarded as a potentially recoverable state (if the RX link is recovered). It is an issue that the firmware allows you to disable stage 2, therefore the ability to do so has been removed (https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/3562). It is unlikely you'd face an issue with motors starting if you plug in the quad before powering on the radio (the exception being if the default AUX channel positions are close to the ARM or AIRMODE box ranges, which in itself is an unsafe configuration). Even in the worst case given that throttle position is at minimum in failsafe the maximum motor speed is determined by min_command, the motors could not run at full throttle. There is no safety issue with airmode as a feature when failsafe is configured correctly. A few tips for minimizing the potential for injury when building, flying and testing: Always perform tests with props removedAlways test your failsafe before ever putting props onAlways set the arm range slider to be activated well away from the default channel value (typically the high end of the channel is adequate, e.g. 1800-2000)Try to keep your radio more than a foot away from your quad to ensure a good radio link at close rangePlug in the battery with a firm grip of the quad (all being well this is unnecessary but is a good belt and braces approach) "},{"title":"Betaflight 3.1.6 -​","type":1,"pageTitle":"BetaFlight-V3.1.x","url":"/docs/release/BetaFlight-V3.1.x#betaflight-316--","content":"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/releases New: Thanks to @jflyper Dynamic bidirectional softserial.

With all the code optimizations (noted in the WIKI), is the Naze still a viable option to continue with, or should I swap it out for a newer FC? Answer from Boris: No NAZE32 and other F1s actually got slower in 3.1. 3.1 is the first version where everything is floating point math. F1 lacks of floating point processor unit so it gets a lot of more to work. Besides that it only has 128k flash what prevents a lot of new optimizing we applied. All optimizations only affect f3, f4 and f7 boards. Instead of running new versions of betaflight or reforking it you can simply stick to the version you use now for example. There is no solution for F1 boards in the future unfortunately and every new feature will NOT be included to it. You are for example willing to give up acc, but 100 others may not. So that's not a solution. I see that Softserial does fit again since latest cleanups (RC9?). There is only like 1kb left on Naze now. question by fftunes:​ If i run 8k/1k, will the PID loop be calculated from an average of the 8 gyro samples, or will it only use 1 sample out of 8? Answer from Boris: There is no averaging. There is IIR filtering, what works faster than averaging. Every sample it's information is taken to the next sample a bit. Btw you can enable simple averaging with chosing FIR filter style. Averaging gives a lot of delay typically. It seems that a lot of guys really missed the early betaflights where all this was discussed a lot. All i can say is to read about the way how filtering works and look up about aliasing. (Filtering is explained in this Wiki) Question by spikerspike97:​ But why do my throttle and yaw rccommands have so much steps and the pitch and roll are super smooth as seen in the BB log? Answer from Boris: Because only roll and pitch have Derivative kick affect. Therefore only those are smoothed by default. You can enable the full smoothing in cli, but I suggest fly it like this. Only reason for smoothed rc inputs is Derivative kick symptom where PIDsum can get very jerky. Note: See the new &quot;rc_interpolation_channels&quot; CLI command below to smooth all channels. question by Ede2016:​ Can you please say a word about average CPU load for BF3.1. Do you suggest less than 50% in the configurator disarmed or armed or what's the best way to analyze which frequency is the maximum recommended? Answer from Boris: Well 50% is a good guideline, but honestly as long as it arms without issues it is fine. As long as every feature works there is enough CPU power. Usually on high CPU usage more less prioritized things will stop working. For example telemetry, BlackBox, current sensor or VBAT would fail first before PID loop or RX code would not be executed. The only true danger with too high cpu before was that motor commands may overlap, but there is a lot of spacing in between all motor commands and it is protected as well with looptime limitations on different protocols. I personally fly everything enabled except accelerometer on my rigs. Question by Jerm357:​ Can anyone suggest some settings for &quot;Angle Limit&quot; and &quot;Sensitivity&quot; in 3.1.3 to get Angle mode to feel like it did in 3.0.1? Answer from Boris: Sensitivity 100 Limit 70 Someone mentioning that 3.1 was a bit more &quot;bumpy&quot; than 3.0.1. Is this true and what to adjust?​ Boris' answer: 3.1 is indeed more &quot;from error&quot; based. Reduce your setpoint weight to make it smoother. I think the current defaults are a bit to much for some setups. Especially on end of fast flips or rolls. In case some don't remember what the setpoint weight was doing. Just a quick explanation in easy language. More to the right (higher)-&gt; More stick acceleration and more sharpy on stick. Your quad reaches faster its target and the rates feel faster, but the motors work harder and have to break faster. More to the left (lower)-&gt; The accelerating and deaccelerating movements of your quad get more dampened. This results in really smoothed motion and pretty much never bouncebacks. Maybe better for freestyle. Weight transition is basically gradual transition of setpoint weight from center stick to full stick. But the effect of it is not really small at the moment. Comment from QuadMcFly: Also worth noting your set-point will likely shift depending on your specific setup, so you can't assume it will be the same on every quad. Heavy, slow transitioning props will need a lower set-point than light fast changing props. For instance I had to run quite low on 5x4.5x3HBN props, but on the Lumenier ButterCutter I'm running almost all the way to the right. Basically I just turn it down till I stop getting bounce-back or &quot;slaps&quot; on hard flips and rolls. More on SetPoint Posted by joshuabardwell​ For setpoint transition, the wiki has a good explanation:Reference PIDC and Setpoint discussion on 3.0.x Wiki pageSo: Delta from error (high D term setpoint weight) has very sharp, immediate stick response. But may have problems with bounceback at the end of flips and rolls, and may provide less smooth flight (especially bad for some freestyle flyers). With high D term setpoint weight, the quad feels very connected and immediate, but also every. tiny. little. finger. motion. is translated instantly to quadcopter motion, which is not necessarily what every pilot wants. Delta from measurement (low D term setpoint weight) has smoother and slower stick response. Quad feels less connected and immediate, but is smoother. Also, measurement is best at stopping bounceback/oscillation at the end of flips and rolls. Think of entering a flip or roll as &quot;positive&quot; stick input, and exiting a flip or roll as &quot;negative&quot; stick input. When the stick is moving away from center, that's positive. When it is moving towards center, that's negative. Delta from error (high D term setpoint weight) is just as likely to cause bounce on positive stick input, in theory, but in practice, we seldom make sharp stick movements when making positive stick input. When re-centering the stick (negative stick input), the crossbar helps the stick come to a sharp stop. When making positive stick input, even when our fingers make very sharp moves, the stick does not come to as abrupt a stop (for most pilots). For some pilots, this will not be true. If you experience ringing oscillation or bounce when doing positive stick inputs, such as if you are doing a four point roll, then you may be the exception to this rule. So then what is setpoint transition. Setpoint transition tries to give you the best of both worlds. When setpoint transition = 1, then NO SETPOINT TRANSITION OCCURS. The D term is calculated based on the setpoint weight, period. When setpoint transition is raised, what happens is that on positive stick input, the D term is calculated based on setpoint weight, and on negative stick input, the setpoint weight is relaxed (reduced) and the D term transitions from error to measurement. The goal here is to give you sharp, &quot;error style&quot; control on positive stick input, and soft, &quot;measurement style&quot; control on negative stick input. This means you get the advantage of error style control but without bounceback at the end of flips and rolls. Here is how I think of it: Set the setpoint weight based on how much error vs measurement feel you want.Lower setpoint transition to fix bounceback at the end of flips and rolls (remember, default is low, and basically nobody complained about stops, ever, in 3.0.1)Raise setpoint transition to increase stability at center stick (especially when running low P and/or low setpoint weight) If setpoint weight is low, then setpoint transition won't do anything because the setpoint can't really be reduced. Also, bear in mind that you should DEFINITELY be tuning P and D when playing with these numbers. P and D interact strongly, and setpoint weight interacts strongly with D, so these three parameters are all interlinked and tuning them is NOT for amateurs. What I would suggest is starting with the default values then tuning P and D as perfectly as possible. Then adjust setpoint weight to extreme values and feel the difference. If you like the softer or sharper feel of a higher/lower setpoint weight, try re-tuning P and D around that value. Finally, adjust setpointn transition to try to tune out bounce at the end of flips and rolls (or other negative stick input. AILERON8 comment:​ I've been raising the setpoint transition to reduce roll/flip bounceback in general. Even if your PIDs are at default this setting has a very pronounced effect on bounce back reduction. Before utilizing this feature I left bounce back removal at the tail-end of tuning. Where as now it's the first thing I do and is easily accomplished. Another use of SetPoint to get a better Tune from fftunes:​ The main issue was, it was too soft/unstable at midstick, but at the same time i could not really increase P much more or it would become excessively noisy. The result was i-term going all over the place to a degree where it caused very unreliable stick feel and even drifting. By increasing transition setpoint from 0.35 to 0.50 it became very solid and reliable around mid-stick and small quick moves, as well as in fast turns where i hold sticks with relatively small inputs. I think after I &quot;fixed it&quot; with transition setpoint, I could even back off with the P's a bit again.

To enable 32kHz mode use CLI setting gyro_use_32khz = ON. (Configurator will not display correct speed until the next configurator update, but you will see the real cycletime). NOTE - only flight controllers with MPU6500, MPU9250, and ICM-series (eg ICM20689) gyro support 32kHz mode. 32khz is added just because it can, but no new harder filtering will be defaulted to that. If you want to fly 32khz you will have to try to optimise your filters by yourself. Default filtering is good enough for 8k gyro sampling, but 32khz requires more filtering depending of setup. I did find out that old blheli esc's for example perform well under 32khz as those are less responsive, while blheli_s and other responsive esc's with better braking really suffer from micros on 32khz. Note from Ksyrium:​ I have two BlueJay F4 rev 3. Initially they flew really wonky, until I learned how to properly soft mount the FC, a fully soft stack did not help to put it mildly. Then one of them refused to arm on 32khz and had 50% CPU instead of 40% on the other. The fix was to set moron threshold to 100. Note from arcaine25:​ I want to run 32k/32k on that revolt V2, but the CPU is at 50%ish.. I know Boris said that would be fine, but I am a little OCD about things, and just don't feel like risking it. 32k/16k flies great as it is, so I couldn't imagine TOO much difference between now and 32/32. While I didn't have to modify moron_threshold at all on the Revolt V2, I absolutely do have to on a Flip32 F4 with an MPU 9250. I have to set it to around 110 - 120 (i'd have to check) in order for it to work, otherwise the Gyro never cal's and it won't arm. Once I set the moron threshold, it works like a charm now that I soft mounted it correctly (previous post about it, as well as in the wiki :-) ). those M3 bobbins from RMRC are absolutely wonderful, and I ordered a bunch of them to keep on hand! Default in 3.1.5 is 48 for moron_threshold. Question from fftunes:​ Did someone compare mpu6500 vs ICM20x at 32k? In Felix' tests the ICM20x did not look so well... Boris' answer: Yes I did. Zero difference.....absolutely zero difference. I fact ICM208601 seemed slightly more prone to motor frequencies hitting its resonant frequency. I also did some more investigation about the new vs old gyros and talked even to invenesense about it. This is the story: The old gyros like MPU60x0 had 3 separate internal gyros. Each axis had its own gyro. That had too high power consumption for mobile phones and there was a demand for more power efficient gyro. So what did they do? They removed 2 gyros from it and made one gyro for all 3 axis to reach this low power demand and succeeded in that! They are selling millions of gyros installed on pretty much every mobile phone. But they did remove some robustness and hardware, which seems crucial for drone applications! The new gyros are also cheaper than the old ones as well, because of that. What we need in drone industry is better gyros and not cheaper less power hungry ones as that's not relevant for us! If you ask me they could make a more expensive gyro with better quality targeted for drones.

In my testing so far (I've had quite huge pitching on throttle blips), the biggest improvement was upping gain to 5. I could not see any difference between gain=5 and gain=6, other antigravity parameters defaulted. Lowering thresh to 200 did not seem to have positive impact, nor raising rate_max to 90. On my setup I now have: set anti_gravity_thresh = 200 set anti_gravity_gain = 6.000 set anti_gravity_rate_max = 90 It's much better, however, there is little pitching up on throttle and after lowering thresh to 200 it added something like propwash on throttle punchouts/blips. Has anyone tested these parameters on their quads? this from my notes, Boris B talking: Dont use that low threshold. I think 300 or 350 should be fine. What does the value mean? 350 for example means 35% of throttle. Once the throttle has been increased or decreased with 35% within 100ms of time than it means that there might be a high gravitational change going on and iterm needs to be accelerated to go to its new value faster. The gain is Ki multiplier. So your igain gets a temporarily nitro boost to prevent pitch up / down behaviour caused by too slow iterm. Default value of 2 is really mellow and is done for safety reasons as I found out a lot of folks were running pretty high igains and with this value iterm might just get pushed easier over the edge. Rate max is the rate where this feature completaly gets ignored.

If you had customised D weight and transition, your sensitivity to quick stick inputs may be different. You may need to modify the new Feed Forward and Feed Forward Transition values to reflect your old settings. The new Anti Gravity code defaults to SMOOTH, and should be better than before, but if you hate it, you can go back to the old STEP method. You will get slightly better dynamic notch functionality than before, but to really improve things on cleaner quads, the settings should be modified from defaults. D weight settings, including changes via OSD or Lua, will be ignored. Goodbye D Setpoint Weight: Hello Feed Forward! This is perhaps the biggest change in recent years: No more D Setpoint Weight. Feed Forward now takes over the role of D setpoint weight, and can be configured independently for each axis (pitch, roll and yaw). set f_pitch = 60, set f_roll = 60, set f_yaw = 60, Allowed range: 0 - 2000  The default values (60) for FF are comparable to the previous 3.4 defaults. NOTE: Your old D weight settings will be lost, in each PID profile, on updating from previous versions. To start using 3.5 with exactly the same Feed Forward behaviour as you had with the old D weight method, calculate FF as (D/26)*D_Weight, where D is your PID 'D' value, and D_Weight is 100 times your D_Weight slider value, or your exact dterm_setpoint_weight value from the CLI. For example, if your D was 26, and your D weight slider was 1.0, the equivalent FF would be 100. If your D was 52, and D weight was 100, an FF of 200 would fly the same on that axis. Yaw FF is covered further down. You may have to update your transition value manually also, but the units, and behaviour, are the same. Feed Forward provides 'dynamic stick boost' or 'dynamic stick responsiveness'. It pushes the quad quicker into turns when the sticks are moved quickly. With Feed Forward, the faster the sticks are moved, the bigger the push. And it doesn't wait for any error to develop, the response is instantaneous. The Feed Forward effect is attenuated around centre sticks by the transition parameter, so the quad can be made more damped (less twitchy) around centre for freestyle type flying by setting transition to 0.5 or 0.1 as usual, but for racing and for direct responses it's best to leave transition at 0. Zero Feed Forward allows D to dampen the quad all the time, even when the quad is instructed to turn quickly. Too much Feed Forward may make the quad too twitchy, and may cause overshoot. The default FF values of 60 are 'mid-range' values. Typically an FF value around 100 is a reasonable amount for a responsive race oriented quad. Overall responsiveness to stick input depends on both P and FF. It is no longer necessary, or desirable, to keep increasing P to improve transient stick responsiveness. Adding FF is a much better way to achieve stick responsiveness than adding P. "},{"title":"Feed Forward on Yaw​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 3.5 Tuning Notes","url":"/docs/tuning/3.5-tuning-notes#feed-forward-on-yaw","content":"Yaw performance has historically been weaker than pitch and roll, leading people to run high levels of yaw P, leading to noise and wobble on yaw, overshoot and bounce back. Not any more! In 3.5, yaw will typically be just as responsive and precise as pitch and roll. At least 50 of FF on yaw is recommended on all quads. The default is 60. P should not need to be more than 40-60 for great yaw responsiveness, in fact lower P reduces yaw noise and bounce back. Really high yaw I works great on most quads, and (strangely enough) actually reduces bounce back, when combined with yaw feed forward. With those changes, yaw responsiveness will be as good, or better, than pitch and roll. With Feed Forward and high I on yaw, bounce back will be minimal, and there is no need to run iTerm_Relax on these settings.  Yaw D is experimental. For normal quads, do not add any D to yaw, or you'll likely get mad yaw oscillation. Yaw D may be useful for tricopters. These are the yaw related values I'd personally recommend for a typical quad: set iterm_relax = RP set p_yaw = 40 set i_yaw = 120 set d_yaw = 0 set f_yaw = 100  Smoother Anti_Gravity Quadcopters, particularly battery on the bottom designs where the centre of gravity is below the centre of thrust, or those where increasing airflow would tend to rotate the quad backwards, need to accumulate I as forward speed increases to maintain the set pitch angle. When the throttle is moved up and down quickly in forward flight, these kinds of quads may pitch their nose up and down. Anti-Gravity is the Betaflight function that helps I adapt more quickly to the new value required after a quick change in airspeed. Before 3.5, Anti_Gravity used an 'all or none' method. Each time a new throttle value arrived, if that step change in throttle exceeded the threshold value, I was multiplied by the Anti_Gravity_Gain amount. But if the next step was just less than the threshold, nothing would happen. Because the time intervals between RC steps vary significantly from radio to radio, the throttle change amount per step could change a lot. Hence it was a bit of a lottery as to whether or not the anti-gravity effect actually worked or not. The new default set anti_gravity_mode = SMOOTH mode increases I in smooth proportion to the rate of change of throttle. There are no sudden steps and no threshold values to worry about - the old threshold is ignored. The overall strength of the effect can be altered by increasing or decreasing the anti_gravity_gain parameter. Your old values should be a good starting point, but the default of 5000 is recommended. Note: When chopping throttle hard to zero, inflow to the props can get reversed, causing marked pitch and roll instability, so don't expect the quad to stay rock solid under those conditions. The old method can be selected by choosing set anti_gravity_mode = STEP. Dynamic Notch Filter tuning The Dynamic Notch has been a vital factor in effective noise management. 3.5 improves the algorithms and allows tuning via the CLI. Appropriate changes can, on many setups, result in less delay and/or even better noise control. Using the defaults preserves the old behaviour. Quadcopters with relatively stiff frames, good motors and new props typically have a clean noise profile, apart from one noise peak that increases as the motor noise goes up. On these quads, the old dynamic notch code tended to go too low during high throttle periods, adding significantly to delay without removing the noise. For noisy quads, the old dynamic notch ended up staying tightly in a range between 200 and 300Hz, acting more like a fixed notch. The code was changed to: operate on post-filter, post-notch input data, so that if you added a notch, the dynamic would not end up on the same pointignore low frequency inputs that sometimes pushed it too lowbetter track peaksgo up to the highest value if there was no peak, to minimise delayallow the user to configure the quality factor so that it could to track a wider range of input dataallow the user to set how wide the notch would be, narrower causing less delay. IMPORTANT NOTE: Noisy quads with warm motors should be left at the defaults.

Technically, this sets the Q factor of the input bandpass filter. The old dynamic notch Q factor, and the current default, was 70. This restricted the range of movement of the dynamic to relatively narrow band, typically between 240 and 300 Hz. Setting dyn_notch_quality to 5 opens the bandwidth up to a range between 150 and 600Hz. This works really well on clean quads with a dominant well defined motor speed related peak that runs up to 600Hz. dyn_notch_width_percent sets how wide the dynamic notch will be. If set to 20, the notch will be +/- 20% of center frequency. If the algorithm would have set centre frequency to 300, a 20% wide notch would cover the range 240 to 360. The current default is 50%, which is about how wide the old dynamic filter was.

The old D weight approach was undesirable for the following reasons: Conceptually, it was confusing. We were linking a factor that improved stick responsiveness to a factor that was supposed to dampen reactions. There were good reasons for this, but it sure complicated things. Previously, when adding D to tune out wobble after quick stick inputs, there was a simultaneous increase in turn rate, so it was not possible to 'just add more D'. Now, when adding more D, all you get is... more D. So D can be tuned in the classical method of adding it to control P wobble much more easily. Previously, any change in D would change how much feed forward or stick responsiveness you got. Now they are entirely independent. We can now plot the Feed Forward and D elements independently in the Blackbox Log Viewer, showing exactly what D does, and how much D and FF contribute, independently, to pidSum. This simplifies blackbox-assisted tuning. Feed Forward requires RC smoothing to be enabled (the Filter method is best). Without RC smoothing, Feed Forward will generate spikes in the motor traces and to prevent this the firmware will disable Feed Forward on any channels not smoothed. So the default has been changed to enable smoothing on all channels (rc_interp_ch = RPYT).

Reversed airflow generates tip vortexes that greatly reduce thrust. 'Dirty' air is turbulent and may buffet the quad as we fly out through it. Whenever we cut throttle in a 180 reversal, any motors that start at zero throttle will be much slower to spin up than the others, leading to very unequal thrust development, crosstalk between axes, secondary PID reactions, and worsening the instability. Hence the need to always keep throttle on during propwash, avoid dropping to zero as much as possible. The end result is highly non-linear motor responses, rendering normal PID control relatively ineffective. The best solution for propwash is flying style. A good pilot can fly a quad with terrible propwash so smoothly that it looks perfect. The key piloting factors are: keep the props moving forward in clean airavoid sharp 180 degree flight reversalskeep some throttle on at all timesnever cut throttle to zero (except during flips, inverted drops and the like)fly smooth arcing turns During propwash, the quad shakes at relatively low frequencies that are easily seen in video, eg 20-30hz. These shakes cannot be filtered out. Quads that deal best with propwash have the following characteristics: able to rapidly change thrust on demand, ie high turn authority, from: -- higher cell count, eg 6S is better than 4S -- lighter, easily spun props (don't over-prop)heavier centre mass (more stable)battery on top (less wobble momentum) From the software perspective: minimise filter delay (warning: less filter delay = less noise filtering = hotter motors) more D is usually better (lots of D can cause hotter motors) -- D_min is the parameter to increase, and/or d_min_gain there is a 'sweet spot' for P, neither too low nor too high = experiment improving PID responsiveness at very low rpm can be useful on some quads (thrust linear) D_min will only make propwash worse, not better 4.0 has been focused on stronger low rpm filtering to avoid jello on HD setups and to keep motors cool. Compared to 3.5, it has less high rpm filter delay, but more low rpm filter delay. In 4.0, D is running at a much lower value - the D_min value - most of the time. The D_min value is active when you are flying smoothly. D_min will only rise to the normal D value during active stick inputs. D will also rise some of the way towards the full D value during propwash events, but not completely. From a propwash perspective, the D_Min value is more important than the D value. Note that although the default 'max' D value is higher in 4.0, this value is only active during flips and rolls and other quick inputs. Hence for propwash, which typically happens at low stick inputs, d_min is what matters most. Overall, in 4.0, propwash is typically less than 3.5 if throttle is sustained, especially above one-third to one-half throttle. Pilots who drop throttle to zero and fly with reverse 180's are likely to get more propwash in 4.0 than 3.5, but pilots who keep throttle up during turns are likely to find it better. If you find that 4.0 has more propwash than before, these are the kinds of changes that may help: use a D value from your old tune, plus about 20%set D_mins to 20% below the D values from your old tune (get min and max D closer together)increase d_min_boost_gain say to 30 Once D is as good as you can get it, try higher or lower P to find the optimal P valuetry adding some thrust_linear (10-20 on a 5&quot;, and look out for wobbles on idle)to reduce filter delay, move the filter minimums a bit higher, carefully. Now to filtering. The default minimum filter minimums are all around 150hz. eg: dyn_lpf_gyro_min_hz, the dynamic gyro lowpass minimumdyn_notch_min_hz, the dynamic notch minimumdyn_lpf_dterm_min_hz, the dynamic D minimum, anddterm_lowpass_hz, the second D lowpass (not a dynamic, but also can go up) If the motors are cool, try increasing all those values say to 170, say, and fly again. Pushing them higher should be done slowly, in small steps, cautiously. Note that on a typical 5&quot;, 250hz equals mid-throttle rpm. Be aware that the higher you go, the more likely the quad is to burn your motors if you fly with a bent prop or as your motors get bearing wobble. Carefully check motor temps on moving these filter values. You may also find that jello suddenly gets worse, or that motor temps abruptly get worse, as you increase these values. RPM based filtering is likely to give less delay and should be considered. Note that this is still experimental at this point. Be aware that the root cause of propwash is flight style. Of the technical causes, the biggest factor, by far, is the delay arising from motor/prop thrust generation delay. Only 10% of the problem is filter delay related. Even if there was zero filter delay, there would still be propwash. Most people will notice some improvement in propwash by lifting D, increasing D_min and pushing the filters higher, or turning some off. At some point, however, the 'returns' get less and less, and the risks of burning motors, and lost power, efficiency, and flight time, get greater. Everybody's situation will be slightly different, and the optimal compromise depends very much on what is most important to us, and what we want to use the quad for.

However the noise generated by the motors extends well above 500Hz, and can be 'louder' than our stick inputs. This noise is detected by the gyros, amplified by the PIDs, D in particular, and fed back to the motors. Since the motors cannot spin as quickly as the noise frequencies, the electricity going backwards and forwards from noise just generates heat. The goal with filtering is to remove the noise and ensure the motors are sent only noise-free clean inputs. All filters induce some delay, and the greater the delay, the greater the tendency for the quad to oscillate in propwash worse and dulling handling. The challenge with filtering is to remove as much noise as possible above the cutoff frequency, retain as much signal as possible below the cutoff frequency, and cause the least delay. But all filters add delay, and the stronger the filtering, the greater the delay. Most noise arises from the rotation of each motor, which shakes the frame a little bit every rotation. This generates an rpm-dependent noise signal at the fundamental frequency of the motor (rpm * 60 in hz), and secondary integral multiples of that frequency (harmonics). All propeller blades also have natural resonant frequencies, and can abruptly and suddenly generate bad oscillations at their resonant frequency when it matches the motor rotation frequency. All this noise is directly related to motor rpm. Although there is some non-rpm related broad band random noise from air turbulence and bearing rattle, the vast majority of the noise is directly rpm related. Using bi-directional DShot, and a BLHeli32 ESC with suitable code, the new betaflight rpm notch filters identify the fundamental and harmonic frequencies of every motor, and target the related noise peaks with very narrow notch filters that almost totally remove motor-frequency-related noise. Usually less filtering is required, resulting in about half to two-thirds the filter delay of 'standard' filtering. credit: JoeLucid. For those of us who can't use rpm filtering, the dynamic notch and the lowpass filtering have been improved so that both work better and with less delay.

The cutoff frequency assigned to the first gyro and D lowpass filter now dynamically increases, with increasing throttle, along a curve that effectively emulates motor rpm. This reduces delay at higher throttle, and allows the dynamic notch to better track the motor peak. At low throttle the dynamic notch can now go lower than before, to assist with removal of fundamental motor oscillations that sometimes cause jello on freestyle quads. The new dynamic lowpass defaults let the dynamic notch can now track motor noise more precisely and over a wider range of frequencies, and clean up noise above the motor fundamental frequency much more cleanly than before. Delay, and propwash, may be no better than 3.4 at low rpm, but typically is significantly improved at higher rpm. Noise suppression across the board will be signficiantly improved.

When active, the dynamic lowpass filter settings override the value of the static lowpass 1 filter. The static lowpass 2 filter, and the static notch filters, remain available and work as before. Not all boards have the flash size to support dynamic lowpass filtering; if your board doesn't show CLI entries for dyn_lpf_gyro_min_hz and the like, it's not supported. Dynamic lowpass filtering becomes active, and the static lowpass 1 value is ignored, when the dynamic maximum is greater than the dynamic minimum, and when the dynamic minimum is greater than zero. For example, these settings will ignore the value in gyro_lowpass_hz and enable dynamic lowpass filtering with a minimum of 150 and maximum of 600hz: set dyn_lpf_gyro_min_hz = 150 set dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz = 600  The following will disable dynamic lowpass filtering and return the quad to a static lowpass at whatever value is set in gyro_lowpass_hz: set dyn_lpf_gyro_min_hz = 0 set dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz = 600  Dynamic lowpass filtering works best when configured as a biquad. That single dynamic biquad will provide all the filtering done previously by both static PT1's of 3.5. Typically static secondary gyro lowpass 2 filter, and no static notches, are required.

It doesn't shift the throttle to cutoff curve upwards, rather it puts a 'floor' below which the cutoff cannot go as rpm falls. dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz, sets the highest frequency the lowpass can rise to, following a smooth curve from zero throttle. Ideally dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz should be set close to the quad's actual max rpm in hz. For a typical 5&quot; this is about 450-500hz, equivalent to 27,000 to 30,000 rpm. Smaller props typically rev faster, eg 600-650hz for 3&quot;-4&quot;, and larger quads rev slower, eg 300-350hz. Max frequency can be determined by displaying an rpm debug in the OSD as you fly, or making a log and performing blackbox or plasmatree analysis. Displaying the max value in the stats screen after disarming can be enabled via set osd_stat_max_fft = ON, make sure to set dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz to at least 610 however as otherwise the dynamic notch will not be able to go high enough and the max FFT reading will be bogus. If on full throttle, the dynamic lowpass doesn't go high enough, it attenuates the motor peak so much that the dynamic notch FFT can't track the motor peak properly, which makes for worse noise overall. Likewise, if the lowpass doesn't go low enough, the FFT may jump up to the first harmonic, leaving a large fundamental frequency to get through. Logging with set debug_mode = DYN_LPF will show the centre frequency of the FFT that drives the dynamic notch (recorded into debug 0). The FFT value should smoothly track the motor frequency from low to high. If the FFT cannot stay stable on the high throttle motor peak, dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz might be able to go a bit higher. If the FFT jumps around a lot at low throttle, you can help it track the primary motor peak better by adjusting dyn_lpf_gyro_min_hz. Betaflight 4.0 uses a single dynamic biquad lowpass on gyro by default, rather than the two fixed PT1's of 3.5, because the biquad has a cleaner pass-band and much steeper cut above the cutoff point. It very effectively attenuates all noise above the anticipated motor peak and allows the dynamic notch to remove that. The end result should be very clean noise spectrum, with the fundamental motor peak, the harmonics, and most ordinary noise removed. Delay is about the same as 3.5 at low rpm but reduced above mid rpm. The default settings pass a lot more gyro data through below cutoff than in 3.5, leading to sharper responses generally, but particularly so at higher rpm.

D actively amplifies higher frequency noise, but we need as much D as possible to help control un-commanded events like overshoot and propwash. Propwash happens in a range around 30-80hz on a well-tuned quad. So we need as much D as possible up to 100hz, and as little as possible above that. At the same time, delay on D really reduces its effectiveness, so we want the least D delay possible. This is almost an impossible challenge! After extensive emulation, we found that the default 4.0 biquad dynamic lowpass settings provide the best outcome. We filter D quite hard, with a dynamic biquad lowpass ranging from 150 - 250hz, and a second fixed static lowpass higher up at 250hz. This setup maximizes D at propwash frequencies around 40-80hz and attenuates D hard above that point. This is the main reason for the cool motors seen with betaflight 4.0, despite functionally less gyro filtering. The second static D filter doesn't absolutely have to be a biquad, a PT1 works well and is preferred if the quad is fairly clean and there's not a lot of high-frequency D noise. The first dynamic D lowpass filter should always be left as a biquad.

The FFT algorithm gives us only one single notch frequency to suppress, even if the motors diverge and make noise on multiple slightly different frequencies. The 3.5 dynamic notch had a Q factor of 0.7 (70 in CLI), which was very wide, resulting in significant filter delay when low. During the 4.0 development period, we found that two, closely spaced, narrower notches, would achieve better noise results with less delay, than one single wider notch. The value dyn_notch_width_percent sets how far apart, in percentage either side of the centre frequency, these paired notches will be. The dyn_notch_q factor of 120 sets them to almost half the width of the dynamic notch in 3.5. For clean quads, or where filter delay is critical, setting dyn_notch_width_percent to 0 runs only one single narrow notch. Motor temperatures are likely to be higher, but filter delay, and probably propwash, will be less. This is not recommended for normal quads but can be helpful on high-performance machines that are flown smoothly with clean props. Another approach for clean quads flown smoothly is to narrow the percentage width and increase the Q factor. For instance, setting width to 4% and Q to 200 results in a very narrow notch with much less delay. Conversely, if the quad is to be flown aggressively with motor speeds all over the place, and if it is noisy, the width percentage can be increased and the Q factor reduced. Any changes should be proportional, eg if the width is increased by a factor of 50%, the Q factor should be 50% lower also, to avoid a big 'gap in the middle' between the pair of notches. The dynamic notch has three frequency ranges in which it can operate, LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH. An AUTO option selects the range depending on the value of dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz, as follows: When dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz is set to zero (disabled), or below 334hz, LOW is selected.When dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz is set from 334 to 610hz, MEDIUM is selected.When dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz is set above 610hz, HIGH is selected. The approximate real world frequency ranges of these modes are: LOW: 80-330hz (best for lower revving machines, or when low frequency resonance is an issue)MEDIUM: 140-550hz (well suited to 5&quot; quads)HIGH: 230-800hz (for very high revving 2.5 - 3&quot; quads) In addition, 4.0 provides a dyn_notch_min_hz value below which the dynamic notch cannot go, regardless of the selected range. The default of 150hz. To hit 100hz resonance peaks, the LOW range option must be active, and dyn_notch_min_hz must be set below 100hz, eg 80hz. This may be useful to avoid jello on some quads. Targeting resonance much below 80hz is unlikely to be successful with the dynamic notch, a fixed notch probably will need to be used. Without rpm filtering, dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz should be set to that frequency expressed in hz, and if the mode is left in AUTO, an appropriate range will be automatically selected. The user can override this by manually choosing the range. It should be high enough to include the maximum motor rpm frequency. The defaults work well with most mini quads. When rpm filtering is active, the dynamic notch and the dynamic lowpass don't need to track and remove motor noise. Typically only one fixed 250hz PT1 gyro lowpass filter is required to remove the small amount of residual high frequency noise once the motor noise is removed by the rpm notches. To disable the first gyro lowpass, gyro_lowpass_hz must be zero, and dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz must also be zero. As noted before, if the dynamic lowpass mode is AUTO, and dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz is zero, the dynamic notch will be forced into LOW mode automatically. If the dynamic notch range needs to range higher than LOW mode's upper limit of 330hz, the dynamic notch mode must be manually set to either MEDIUM or HIGH. Typically, in rpm mode, the rpm filter removes the motor noise very effectively, allowing the dynamic filter to deal with frame resonances, which are not uncommon in well used quads. Very clean quads often don't have significant resonant noise peaks, and won't need or benefit from having the dynamic notch active. Turning the dynamic notch off saves CPU usage and reduces overall filter delay. The only way to know if you do, or don't, have resonant noise peaks, is to perform spectral analysis of a blackbox log using PID Toolbox or equivalent. The log should be recorded with dynamic notch off with set debug_mode = gyro_scaled so the incoming gyro noise picture, resonance and all, can be clearly seen. If resonant peaks are present, and you want to configure the dynamic notch to deal with them, but otherwise stop it going low and adding delay, choose the highest range that includes the resonant peak line, and set dyn_notch_min_hz to about 10% below that peak. Some examples: for a single resonant peak at 300hz: LOW range with dyn_notch_min_hz at 270hz,for a single resonant peak at 400hz, choose MEDIUM with dyn_notch_min_hz at 370hz,for a low frequency resonant peak of 100hz, choose LOW with dyn_notch_min_hz at 80hz. If the resonance peak is narrow, a highish Q value (120 to 200) with width = 0 will minimise delay. When the dynamic notch tracks into very low frequencies, its associated delay becomes significant, particularly if Q is wide. Sometimes for very low, very fixed frequency resonances, a single fixed notch can be a better solution. Certainly that is the only way to deal with resonant peaks below about 70hz. The 3.4 dynamic notch was a single Q=0.7 notch that moved in a relative frequency band between about 220hz and 300hz. The 4.0 notch can be similarly configured if desired, but it won't work as well as the default settings. Tuning the dynamic notch is best done with the aid of logging. credit: iCr4sh, ctzsnooze, the skunkworks team "},{"title":"D Only TPA​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 4.0 Tuning Notes","url":"/docs/tuning/4.0-Tuning-Notes#d-only-tpa","content":"Throttle PID Attenuation (TPA) has been around a long time. It attenuates the PIDs linearly start at the threshold throttle value, reaching the set percentage attenuation at full throttle. The original purpose was to reduce wobble on full throttle in highly tuned quads. I was removed from TPA around 2.9, and since then TPA operated on both P and D. In 3.5, D was split into D and FF, and we then started wondering about what TPA should do to those individual factors. We noted that D mediated noise was often much worse at high throttle, and, a bit to our surprise, that we could cut D as much as 70-80% D cut on full throttle without P wobbles. By not attenuating P or FF with throttle, TPA on D alone maintain stick responsiveness at high throttle, and markedly reduce full-throttle noise and motor heat. Hence, TPA has been configured by default to be active only on D in 4.0. These are my current settings: set tpa_rate = 75 set tpa_breakpoint = 1400 set tpa_mode = D  To return TPA to classic P and D attenuation, as in 3.5 and earlier, paste into the CLI: set tpa_rate = 10 set tpa_breakpoint = 1650 set tpa_mode = PD  Typically a freestyle quad might use less 'TPA on D' and a race quad say 75% from 1400.

This reduces I related bounce-back or overshoot after fast inputs. We now use high I values on pitch and roll to enhance stability on windy days, so setting iterm_relax properly is more important than before. The iterm_relax_cutoff frequency determines how quickly iterm relax will start, and how quickly it will unwind. For racing we want quick, responsive I accumulation, with faster release, so that I will be sustained and strong in very tight turns, yet release quickly. This will help the quad hold the set radius in tight, fast spiral turns or slaloms. We would set the cutoff to higher frequencies, eg 30-40hz. Higher frequencies suit more responsive machines and tracks with many sustained turns. The downside of setpoint mode with high cutoff values is that there probably will be some I mediated overshoot with flips and rolls, but that's not usually a concern while racing. The more freestyle / LOS oriented GYRO type of iterm_relax has not changed. It comes on a bit later and lasts longer, controlling bounce-back after hard flips and rolls better than setpoint mode. In gyro mode, iterm_relax_cutoff should be set according to the authority of the quad. 20hz is good for a reasonably strong 5&quot; freestyle setup, 10hz for a 6&quot; or lower authority machine, and 5hz for larger props and heavier machines. Gyro mode with excessively low cutoff frequencies aren't ideal for racing, or very tight spiral turns around flags or gates, because the quad will become a bit unpredictable in how it handles tight turns.

For example, if the flight controller required a 40% motor differential to make a turn, but at low throttle, this would need one motor to go 10% below zero, airmode will increase throttle by by 10%, retaining normal responsiveness. Airmode works great like that, at low and high throttle. But, if there are noise spikes superimposed on any one motor trace, big enough to make that motor to exceed 100%, airmode will cut the peaks off the noise and 'reflect' the chopped off spikes into the other three motors, upside down. This causes sharp downing spikes on the other motor signals and harsh digital clipping of the 'overshooting' motor signal. Which adds to the frequency content and amount of the noise. That's the last thing you want on full throttle. This is a problem at both ends of the throttle range, contributing to hot motors on full throttle, and bad grinding noises or instability on arming. By measuring the amount of noise in the motor signals, an additional throttle lift (or cut) can be dynamically provided, based on the magnitude of the noise, and hence only as much as needed, to stop the noise reflection problem. There is one CLI adjustment, transient_throttle_limit, which sets the maximum amount of throttle boost or cut allowed in percent. 15% is quite generous and rarely needed in most quads. As far as I know, there's no downside to having it this high under normal conditions. Having it set this high may, however, help you fly home with a bent prop and not cook the motors. credit: JoeLucid "},{"title":"Improved yaw PIDs​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 4.0 Tuning Notes","url":"/docs/tuning/4.0-Tuning-Notes#improved-yaw-pids","content":""},{"title":"The following notes apply ONLY to un-integrated yaw configuration! If you're flying integrated yaw, the tuning process is completely different!​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 4.0 Tuning Notes","url":"/docs/tuning/4.0-Tuning-Notes#the-following-notes-apply-only-to-un-integrated-yaw-configuration-if-youre-flying-integrated-yaw-the-tuning-process-is-completely-different","content":"Yaw is primarily driven by the rate of acceleration of the motor, especially at lower rpm. As the motors accelerate, a counter-force is applied to the frame. This gives instant, un-delayed yaw acceleration. The driving force for yaw from acceleration is greater the higher the rate of change of rpm, and is greater with heavier motors and props. Acceleration is reduced linearly by motor/arm inertial mass and the square of arm length. Acceleration-driven yaw rate of change can be very quick, since changes in motor acceleration are near-instant. At higher rpm a simple rpm dependent air-drag yaw factor becomes relevant and sustains the yaw at a steady rate. This is very different from pitch and roll, where thrust is basically linearly related to rpm, and is always a bit delayed since it takes a while to change rpm. And our standard PID controller assumes a linear relationship between rpm and thrust, which is very definitely not the case with yaw. Hence tuning yaw for optimal performance using classical PIDs is very different from pitch and roll. That's why JoeLucid developed the experimental integrated yaw concept, which is intended to permit a more traditional method of tuning yaw. When tuning classical PIDs on yaw, keep these things in mind: D must always be zero. Non-zero D values are unhelpful and cause oscillation. iterm_relax should not be enabled on yaw; it should be set iterm_relax = RP P provides rapid changes to motor signals but rarely overshoots. P is a quick responder to stick inputs, and also responds quickly to overshoots, wind shear, collisions etc. The main problem with P on yaw is that it readily generates noise on the yaw axis, and yaw oscillation from P is quite common, both of which limit how much P can be used. Typically it's not a great plan to use more than 35 of yaw P on a standard quad. FF acts very much like P, in that it adds push to stick inputs. But that's all it does. It does not add noise to the motor traces, and it does not stabilize the quad against un-commanded inputs. Adding FF reduces reliance on P and I during yaw spin initiation. Too much FF will cause a fast overshoot at peak input rate, and sudden under-shoot the moment the sticks go still. That's been the typical appearance in 3.5 yaw logs. The value entered for 'I' in the PIDs changes only how quickly I accumulates. It doesn't change the amount of I you get in the PID traces, it only changes how quickly you get to that amount. The amount depends only on how much sustained error there is for it to fix. We have found that the amount of I that works best on yaw is very, very high. Hence Betaflight 4.0 now multiplies yaw I internally by 2.5 times. If you set yaw I to 100, you will get yaw I of 250 internally. This greatly improves yaw performance, with less overshoot because less FF is needed. The 4.0 yaw defaults, with zero FF, will work extremely well for most typical yaw moves, with smooth noise-free accurate rendition of setpoint to response. For higher rate yaw spins, some tuning may be required. If the amount of P and I isn't enough to achieve the yaw rate during the move, the sustained error will result in a high accumulated I signal, leading to some overshoot. If the motors are not maxing out, increasing I further, and adding more FF may help track the yaw input more closely, reducing the amount error during the move, and thereby reducing the amount of I overshoot. If the motors are maxing out during rapid yaw changes, the best solution is to just target a lower peak yaw rate, or be a bit more gentle in acquiring that rate. The alternative solution is to enable iterm_relax on yaw, which will block most of the I accumulation, and push the yaw move with a lot of FF. Typically this won't provide as good yaw control for slower rate moves, though.

It sends no data for variable periods of time when the sticks move slowly, until the amount of stick movement becomes big enough to send a new value. This is intended to reduce jitter. Unfortunately, anytime no data is sent, FF drops abruptly to zero. The result is a very steppy FF trace during small inputs, and a reduction in fine control. Disabling the ADC filter will force the radio to transmit whatever data it has, new data every packet, no matter how small the change. This means transmitting some jitter but improves fine control and cleans up the FF trace a lot. The Hall effect gimbals have very little jitter and the ADC can be turned off without problems. Potentiometer based gimbals may be OK but old ones often have a lot of jitter. If you have a FrSky radio with Hall gimbals: In the hardware tab of the radio configuration menu, uncheck the ADC filter box. Note: The special edition radios often come with a firmware build that has the ADC filter off already.In the BetaFlight Configurator Receiver tab, set RC Deadband and Yaw Deadband to 0.

RPM filtering almost completely removes motor-dependent noise from the PID loop. The dynamic notch can then seek out and remove any remaining resonant noise peaks.

On gyro, the default filtering is relatively light. Gyro lowpass1 is dynamic, ranging from 200 to 500hz. Gyro lowpass2 is static at 250hz. D filtering, in contrast, is quite strong. D lowpass1 is dynamic, ranging from 70-170hz. D lowpass 2 is static at 150hz. The reason for strong, low-throttle, D lowpass filtering is to prevent D related 'fly to the moon' events that occasionally happened in 4.0.x with quads that were highly susceptible to D resonance. With 4.1 filters this should be far less likely. Even though the default filtering is quite strong, resulting in cool motors on any reasonable build, propwash suppression should be alright, especially if throttle is maintained in the turns. This is because PT1 filters have less delay than biquad fiters for the same cutoff frequency, and because the filter cutoffs rise quickly as throttle increases. If your quad flies well with cool motors on the default filter settings, propwash can be reduced by shifting the lowpass filtering higher. Configurator version 10.6 makes it really easy to do this. Just move both filter sliders to the right, and the cutoffs will move higher, reducing delay, and improving propwash.

When rpm filtering is enabled, the dynamic notch filter has a different role. It no longer has to track and remove the motor peaks - rpm filtering does that. Instead, it can focus on whatever residual resonant peaks exist on the quad. Not all quads have resonance issues, but many do. We recommend keeping the dynamic notch filter enabled on all quads, even those with rpm filtering. When the rpm filter is in use, the dynamic notch can be a single, narrower, notch, rather than the usual wider, dual notches that are needed when the rpm filter isn't active. The following snippet makes those changes, and cuts delay arising from the dynamic notch to about 1.4 of normal. It should be applied when using the rpm filter: set dyn_notch_width_percent = 0 set dyn_notch_q = 250  And this restores the default values for use without RPM filtering set dyn_notch_width_percent = 8 set dyn_notch_q = 120  If RPM filtering is being used, and a narrower notch works well without hot motors, you can try turning it off altogether. Be sure to make a cautious test flight and check motor temperatures! If the quad later develops frame resonances from carbon flex, or from soft / bent props, you may get burnt motors when the dynamic filter completely off. Don't do this unless you are confident about your build integrity and are sure the RPM filtering is working well. If you have logging capabilities, a log made with the dynamic notch on vs off can show whether it is contributing usefully to the overall noise control situation. To reduce delay, or to focus on specific resonance bands, the dynamic notch can be configured to operate over a limited range of frequencies. Three ranges are possible, LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH. In 4.0.x, the default range setting was AUTO, in which the code chose a range based on the user-configured value of dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz. The idea was that high max values would only be used on high rpm quads. But now high max values may be used on normal quads, when moving the sliders up, for example. In 4.1, the dynamic notch now defaults to MEDIUM mode, and it stays there regardless of dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz. In MEDIUM mode it can deal with resonance bands from about 140hz to about 600hz. This is appropriate for most normal quads. For large quads - 7&quot; or greater - with lower than 150hz resonance lines, LOW may be more appropriate. HIGH can be useful on high-rpm quads, in combination with a higher than normal dyn_notch_min_hz value, to keep the dynamic notch tracking a specific and relatively high resonant peak, and not going any lower than needed. This can reduce its delay contribution.

Each new RC step would cause a sharp step up in the setpoint, which would result in a sharper feed forward spike. To attenuate these spikes, a carefully adjusted low-pass filter on the incoming setpoint data (rc_smoothing_input_hz) was followed by a second low-pass on the feed-forward value (rc_smoothing_derivative_hz). In 4.0x, with rc_smoothing in auto mode (set rc_smoothing_input_hz = 0, set rc_smoothing_derivative_hz = 0), these filter values were set dynamically according to the step intervals between successive incoming RC data points. In 4.1, the feed forward amount is calculated from the change in successive setpoint values, using an interpolation method, and outputs a clean step up in feed forward without spiking. This doesn't need a lot of filtering. The new command is ff_interpolate_sp and it has three options: OFF : normal 4.0x lowpass RC filteringON : new 4.1 interpolated feed forward, 4.0 style lowpass filtering on setpointAVERAGED : same as ON but with two-point moving average over the feed forward signal. This is the new default. With non OpenTx radios or OpenTx 2.3+ with systems that do not dynamically change the transmission rate, a good low-delay set of RC smoothing values for interpolated feed forward in 4.1 would be: set rc_smoothing_input_hz = 40 set rc_smoothing_derivative_hz = 100 set rc_smoothing_input_type = PT1 set rc_smoothing_derivative_type = PT1  When using with TBS Crossfire or Frsky R9 on OpenTx radios these settings will dampen aliasing artifacts that currently happen with those systems (and probably any external module on OpenTx radios). set rc_smoothing_derivative_hz = 20 set rc_smoothing_derivative_type = PT1  The following will return to the default 4.0 auto lowpass settings: set rc_smoothing_input_hz = 0 set rc_smoothing_derivative_hz = 0 set rc_smoothing_input_type = BIQUAD set rc_smoothing_derivative_type = BIQUAD  These changes were originally described in the ff_2.0 documentation.

This slight extra delay is very small and is only noticeable in very fast direction reversals. While some Rx systems are better than others, the majority lose data packets frequently. The amount of FF jitter from these erratic Rx signals is so bad that we strongly recommend keeping the averaging active.

When commencing a move, stick acceleration is positive. We now provide positive 'boost' that gets added to the feed forward signal, proportional to that acceleration. At the end of a move, as soon as the sticks decelerate, we will actively reduce the amount of feed forward, reducing overshoot. The default ff_boost amount is 15. This amplifies the strength of the normal feed forward overall, but particularly early on, reducing lag when making quick turns. It backs off the feed forward when the sticks slow down, reducing overshoot. Overall the effect is of greater accuracy when making fast direction changes. If the quad is tracking well, overall, but still has a bit of lag at the beginning of fast inputs, and if the RC signal is quite good, up to 30 of ff_boost may be used. The main limiting factor with boost is when RC input packets are delayed, absent, or too early. This can cause large steps in the RC setpoint, leading to even greater steps in the boost component of FF. We have two ways of attenuating these spikes. The first is a very effective, zero-delay attenuation method, based on inhibiting peak boost values due to spikes, and letting smaller 'real' stick-related boost values through. So long as the boost element is well below the ff_spike_limit threshold, it passes through largely unchanged; the larger boost signals arising from spikes are attenuated very strongly. The default ff_spike_limit threshold of 50 works well in most cases. If the Rx trace is clean with mostly regular steps, a higher threshold, eg 60-80, will allow a quicker response to fast stick inputs. However if the Rx signal has many steps, moving the threshold higher may result in an unacceptably noisy FF and/or motor trace. The second method is by averaging successive feed forward data points. This has been described above in the section on feed forward interpolation. It does add delay equal to half the normal RC interval.

Get the quad tuned properly first, with whatever FF and boost works best. Look at the start of a hard flip in BlackBox Explorer and see if there is any overshoot. If with ff_max_rate_limit = 100 there is still too much overshoot, try ff_max_rate_limit = 95. If the overshoot is too well controlled, try 105 to 110.

Stick responsiveness has been improved with slightly higher default I and feed forward (FF) values on pitch and roll. ff_boost is enabled by default, and in combination with the higher default feed-forward value and the reduced delay from feed forward interpolation, stick responsiveness should be significantly stronger. If your quad seems too twitchy, lower FF using the stick responsiveness slider. Throttle PID Attenuation (TPA) now defaults to 0.65 starting at 1250 throttle units. This means more TPA at full throttle, but with a smoother range of D reduction. Combined with the changes to PT1 filtering, this seems to improve mid throttle oscillations compared to 4.0.x in most cases. The biggest change is the provision of sliders to simplify tuning the PID values. Quads with low authority (heavy 4S GoPro machines or 7&quot; with slightly over-propped motors) will usually do better with the master PID slider moved to the right a bit, maybe as high as 1.5x. High-authority machines, eg lightweight LOS quads, will usually do better with the master PID slider to the left, say 0.7 - 0.8. The amount of feed forward is easily adjusted with the 'stick responsiveness' slider. Cinematic type HD quads may prefer a lower amount of feed forward especially if their long-range radio makes frequent large glitches. Racers may prefer a higher amount of feed forward.

'Low-authority' quads, such as low-power whoops, ducted HD quads, heavy 4S freestyle builds, and many 7&quot; and larger builds, and endurance builds, all share the common problem of being slower to respond to quick inputs than 'normal' quads. They tend to get bounce-back after quick flips or rolls, and after quick yaw inputs. This paragraph explains why these kinds of quads get bounce-back, and how to fix it. The PID I term, in Betaflight, provides precision in tight turns, pitch accuracy in fast forward flight, stability on windy days, stability in drops and mid-flip, controls asymmetric aero drag effects, and generally cleans up the myriad small persistent residual errors that P can't entirely deal with. It accumulates a correction for small residual errors over time, and that correction keeps the quad exactly on track. Higher I values will do this faster and more completely, especially in tight turns and on windy days, where there are small persistent residual errors that P, D or FF are unable to control. Relatively high I is one of the reasons that Betaflight 4.x tracks so accurately in tight turns and on long straights. If the pilot requests a change in turn rate that is too quick for the quad to deliver, the gyro signal will lag setpoint, and will be a large error signal. I will start to accumulate to help correct this. iTerm_relax will try to control this accumulation. If iterm relax is inadequate for the amount of error, a large amount of I may accumulate, and when the pilot stops the flip, all that accumulated I will drives a movement in the reverse direction, which slowly fades away, until it gets back to zero. That's the single, fairly slow, 'bounce-back' event that the pilot sees when they terminate the flip. This phenomenon is called 'iterm windup'. We use the iterm_relax and iterm_windup settings to control iTerm related bounce back. The defaults for these parameters work very well in 4.2 for 'normal authority' builds. iterm_relax, at default of 15, strongly suppresses I accumulation during normal flip and roll inputs. iterm_windup works for yaw problems, and since it usually isn't needed at all, it is off by default. 'Low-authority' quads, however, will tend to get bounce-back after quick flips or rolls, and after quick yaw inputs, because they have much more delay and error than normal in relation to the stick input. Betaflight's iterm_relax and iterm_windup values will need to be adjusted for these machines. You know you have a low authority quad when you get an annoying bounce-back after a 600 degree/s flip or roll, and/or a bounce-back after a quick yaw input. Other clues are that you require a higher than normal hover throttle value (ie your hover throttle is more than 25%), or you get slow wobbles in drops or at low throttle. For yaw, any machine with longer arms - anything bigger than 6&quot; - will lose yaw authority and typically have issues with yaw bounce-back and yaw jump. Bounce-back problems due to iTerm windup can be addressed in three ways. The best way is to change the tune or modify the hardware of the quad to make it more responsive. Ideally the quad gets a tune that responds so quickly that the defaults work properly. This will have the added benefit of improving the overall handling of the machine as well. Let's think about how we could do this. Low-authority machines typically require higher P and FF. Maybe up to double the default P and triple the default FF in some cases. There is a limit to how high you can go, but you need to go high. Most likely D needs to go up as well as P, or you'll get P wobbles, and D noise may be the limiting factor on how high you can go. You should push FF hard, and move the 'P and D gain' slider progressively to the right. These changes should reduce the wobble and the bounce back because it will get the machine turning more quickly and reduce error magnitude and duration. Note that very high D will delay responsiveness and make bounce-back worse. Getting the right P and D values is really important on these quads. If you still have wobble and bounce-back despite tuning P and FF, you should then try reducing I, trying half of normal or a third of normal. Very low I will make the quad less stable overall, so don't go too low. On the hardware side, over-propped quads will have difficulty changing thrust quickly. Always try smaller or lighter props that the motors can spin up more readily. Optimising the prop to the motors can make a huge difference to authority related issues such as bounce-back. On very large quads, beast or X-class, rotating the motors inwards will improve yaw authority. Any change that improves bounce-back means that you've got the quad responding more quickly and precisely, and that's a good metric of the success - or otherwise - of your tuning efforts. The next best way is to reduce your maximum pitch, roll or yaw rate, or just fly more smoothly, entering or leaving the flips or yaws a little more slowly. By not pushing harder than your hardware can deliver, you'll get a good overall performance envelope without extreme tuning. Tuning the provided iterm_relax and iterm_windup functions. iterm_relax is what Betaflight uses to prevent unwanted I accumulation for really fast pitch and roll inputs. The associated iterm_relax_cutoff value determines the strength of the suppression effect and how long it lasts for. Lower values suppress I accumulation more strongly and for longer, and are what you need to control iTerm related bounce-back. Try stepwise reducing iterm_relax_cutoff from the default of 15 to 10, then 7, then 5, noting the improvement in bounce-back each time. Settle on the highest value that 'works'. The lower you go, the less accurate your tighter turns will become. So there is a bit of a trade-off to consider. You want the highest number that controls your bounce-back. We strongly recommend keeping iterm relax in the default setpoint mode. There is no need to change to gyro mode in 4.2. Iterm relax will likely perform better in setpoint mode than gyro mode in 4.2. For yaw bounce-back, optimising yaw PIDs can improve matters, and should be attempted first. On yaw, FF will provide the initial push as the sticks move, P a kind of boost soon after, and I does most of the work. For good yaw performance, all three elements are needed. Ideally you get a log and adjust yaw P, FF and I so that for small to medium yaw inputs you get responsiveness that matches your pitch and roll lag. You will see that for big, fast yaw inputs, the motors quickly get driven to a very high differential, with one pair at 100% and the other at zero. This means the quad cannot deliver what you are asking it to do. iterm windup and bounce back are inevitable when this happens. iterm_windup is what fixes this problem on yaw. In 4.2 iterm_windup applies exclusively to yaw, previously it applied on all axes. It suppresses I accumulation whenever the motor differential exceeds the set percentage. Default is 100, meaning 'off'. 70 is good value to prevent yaw bounce back on low authority quads. By stopping yaw accumulation at 70% motor differential, iterm windup won't happen whenever we command yaws that the quad cannot achieve, and I mediated yaw bounce-back won't be a problem. The great thing about iterm_windup is that it doesn't impair reactions to smaller inputs - they will be completely unaffected. acc_limit and acc_limit_yaw are settings that selectively suppress I accumulation when the pilot is requesting a rate of change of setpoint (ie, an acceleration) that is too high for the quad to achieve. By default they are off. They only suppress I only while the setpoint is changing rapidly, and that is only briefly. Since bad iterm windup can happen over a prolonged period, including after the sticks stop moving, they are not recommended.

No special configuration is required; it just works. You get improved filter accuracy, cooler motors, longer flights; RPM Q factor can usually be set higher without problems. The RC input handling code has also been improved and is significantly more precise, leading to smoother FF traces than before. The gyro loop rate is now locked at the 'native' gyro sampling rate and cannot be adjusted by the user. Usually this is 8k. The PID loop rate can, and should, be adjusted to suit the capabilities of the processor. The PID loop time is displayed at the bottom of the Configurator. The most important thing for rpm filtered setups is stability of that loop time. One percent loop time error means that the rpm notch filters will be 1% away from their correct positions. Without RPM filtering, most F4 and F7 boards will run perfectly fine with 8k PID loops. WIth RPM filtering, F405 and F7xx boards should also be OK with 8k PID loops, but F405's are more accurate at 4k. We recommend 4k, then try 8k; only stay with 8k if it seems at least as stable as 4k. F411's should be set to 4k and typically will require overclocking to get optimal results. To keep jitter at the lowest possible value, disable blackbox logging. While logging, use 1k unless higher rates are essential, and disable debugging unless a debug is needed. When running 4k or 2k PID loops, aliasing artefacts can arise from the down-sampling process. These are usually prevented by the gyro lowpass 2 filter, which runs in the gyro loop. It is the only lowpass filter running at gyro loop speed. If it is disabled, a simple 2-point averaging filter is automatically enabled in its place when 4k or lower PID loop rates are selected. 2-point averaging reduces aliasing artefacts reasonably well for 4k PID loops, though not as well as a lowpass 2 at 1000hz, but does not fully prevent aliasing at 2k. Hence gyro lowpass 2 should not be disabled with 2k PID loops. 8k PID loops have no aliasing issues, so gyro lowpass 2 can be freely configured for noise reduction, or disabled if it's not needed, without concerns relating to aliasing. With a 4k PID loop, if you don't need gyro lowpass 2 for noise reduction purposes, set it as high as it can go (currently to 1000Hz), or turn it off. With a 2k PID loop, don't disable gyro lowpass 2.

When configured aggressively, Feed Forward reacts immediately to any stick input. The basic feed forward component is proportional to the speed with which the sticks move, and the boost component is proportional to the instantaneous acceleration of the sticks. Aggressive feed forward can reduce setpoint to gyro delay to zero for most inputs, leading the high levels of control and immediacy required by the very best racers. Softer feed forward, including with Feed Forward Transition of 30, can make for a very smooth centre feel with quick responses to flick inputs, ideal for modern freestyle or cinematic purposes. The primary downside of aggressive feed forward is jitter when trying to fly smooth lines. Most radios have some jitter in their signal, many drop packets or send duplicate packets, and we all have some finger/thumb shake. If the quad reacts immediately to the tiniest input, it may 'tremble' or be a bit nervous when it should be in smooth forward flight or during gentle long radius turns. The needs of the race pilot differ greatly from those of a person wanting super smooth HD footage, so in 4.2 we've put a lot of thought into how best address these differing requirements. Feed forward depends greatly on the stability of the RC link, and the smoothness of the steps between incoming packets. We strongly recommend that Crossfire users update to the latest CRSF_Shot software (including the update to OpenTx that provides external module sync for CRSF).

"},{"title":"Dynamic battery sag compensation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 4.2 Tuning Notes","url":"/docs/tuning/4.2-Tuning-Notes#dynamic-battery-sag-compensation","content":"This PR applies an initial motor output reduction when the battery is full, and boosts motor output upwards during the flight, to quickly compensate for sagging battery voltage as it happens. This gives a more consistent stick feel, both for throttle and PID, over the usable battery voltage range, compensating for the usual loss of performance as the battery sags. The quad will not feel super aggressive at the start of a flight, or dull at the end. It is best enabled with: set vbat_sag_compensation = 100 set vbat_pid_gain = OFF  This means '100% compensation for voltage sag'. NOTE 1: The quad must have an on-board battery voltage sensor. It can't be enabled with ESC based serial voltage telemetry, because the voltage values change too slowly. NOTE 2: The older vbat_pid_gain method of battery sag compensation should not be used at the same time. NOTE 3: Only use this if you have active battery monitoring via telemetry or OSD!** You will get no loss of 'stick feel' until the battery starts falling below 3.5V. NOTE 4: It won't work in 3D mode. The code compensates for voltage changes from 4.2V down to the user's configured warning voltage of 3.5V. A fall from 4.2V to 3.5V is about a 16% reduction in voltage. Withs 100% compensation, a motor output reduction of about 16% will be applied when the battery is full. As the battery voltage falls, motor output is dynamically boosted back towards normal, canceling out the effect of the sag. Once the battery falls to 3.5V or lower, motor output will be normal, or back to 100%, and no further compensation is possible. Both throttle and motor limits may need to be adjusted after enabling sag compensation. If you already have a static motor_output_limit value below 100, this code further reduces motor output below that value. You may want to lift motor_output_limit by about 10 for similar overall performance. If you have a throttle limit, there is usually no need to change it. To keep a bit more aggression at the start, at the cost of having a bit more 'sag' during the flight, apply less than full compensation, eg 50% compensation is set vbat_sag_compensation = 50. Setting more than 100% compensation can help whoops that sag really badly, but usually isn't needed. There are two kinds of battery sags: Slow falls, over minutes, as the battery loses overall voltage and capacityQuick sags due to transient high current loads during throttle blips To only cover the slow fall, set vbat_sag_lpf_period to 200 (20 seconds period, or a time constant of about 3.3 seconds). This will not compensate for quick transient drops. High values make sense for slow flyers or cinematic type flying. To respond quickly, stick with the default vbat_sag_lpf_period of 2, or 200ms. This has a time constant of about 33ms, fast enough to respond very quickly to fast throttle blips and quick split-S turn type sags. Whoops tend to be flown at lower voltages than mini quads, so the warning voltage is often set lower, eg 3.3V. The attenuation range, and the initial maximum motor output suppression value, will be a bit bigger. In this case, slightly reduceing the compensation amount, eg to say 80%, will stop it feeling very dull at the start. However, some whoops sag a lot, and on some a value above 100 may be useful to get a constant feeling across the battery range. No adjustments are required when using HV cells. Enabling the BATTERY debug will show the compensation amounts, as they happen, in the OSD, or in a log. Battery debug 2 is 'compensationStrength, a value between 0 and 100. Zero means you're at the low end of the battery range, and no further compensation is available. 100 means you've got a fresh battery and your maximum configured compensation is active. It can be used as a simple 0-100 battery status indicator, if you like. Battery debug 3 carries the actual percentage reduction applied to motor output. A normal value for a full battery would be about 160 (16%). If you were to apply only 50% compensation, your would see only about 8% attenuation when full.

Using the latest Configurator is essential. Actual rates with zero expo and a low centre sensitivity is strongly recommended for cinematic or freestyle flying. The two new rates modes are named ACTUAL and QUICK. They allow direct and completely independent configuration of centre stick feel, expo, and max roll rate. Centre stick 'feel' or 'sensitivity' is determined by the angle of the rates curve around the centre stick position. In both new methods, this is set directly and not affected by any other rate parameter. QUICK rates retains the traditional rcRate value as used in previous Betaflight versions to set centre sensitivity; you can keep the same value you've always used. ACTUAL rates lets you set your target centre rate is set in degrees/second. To convert your old rcRate value to degrees/second, multiply it by 200. For example, an rcRate of 1.0 would be entered as a centre sensitivity of 200 in ACTUAL rates. In ACTUAL rates, the centre and max numbers have the same units, and are directly comparable in terms of 'how it feels' in the centre compared to further out. In both the new models, expo shifts the curve further out, but doesn't change either the centre sensitivity (slope of the RC rate curve at centre), or the max rate. Higher expo extends the centre rate further out, so the quad won't spin fast until your sticks are a long way out. This is often favoured for freestyle or LOS acro. Lower expo keeps your low-sensitivity range more to the centre, and gives you more predictable reactions across the stick travel range once you leave centre. This is favoured by racers, with relatively high centre sensitivity, and by cinematic HD pilots, who want extremely low centre sensitivity without losing too much authority when they bring the sticks further out. In ACTUAL rates, the amount of expo can be reduced below what was previously possible. This is really good for cinematic freestyle, where we want strong softness at centre, but a fairly early transition to strong authority. For LOS acro, high expo in Actual mode gives a more linear stick feel over a wider range, then a sudden increase for high-speed flips only when the sticks are pushed well out. In QUICK rates, expo has a more traditional curve. The different curves can be visualised in Configurator. Finally, maximum rate now will be unchanged when the user adds deadband. This online calculator allows visualisation of Betaflight vs Actual Rates, making it easy to convert your old rates. This online calculator helps with Quick Rates.

To manually configure the threshold, choose ON and set the value you want in yaw_spin_threshold. We hope that AUTO to be best for all users.

This means that when PID I was increased, the strength of the anti-gravity effect also increased, and vice versa. This could lead to I mediated wobbles on rapid changes of throttle if the user increased their PID I to high values, or, lead to inadequate anti-gravity effect if the user decreased PID I. In 4.2, the anti-gravity effect is independent of the user's PID I value, and is modified by anti-gravity gain alone. If a user previously ran higher PID I values than default, they will need to increase their anti-gravity gain value, and vice versa, if they want the same anti-gravity effect as before. The change should be in proportion to the ratio of their previous I value to the 4.1 and 4.2 default value. "},{"title":"Improved Dynamic Notch filter​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 4.2 Tuning Notes","url":"/docs/tuning/4.2-Tuning-Notes#improved-dynamic-notch-filter","content":"The dynamic notch filter has been extensively revised. It now identifies and tracks peaks more accurately, and over a wider frequency range. Performance will be better on most quads. It will also be more accurate with non-standard gyro rates. Instead of choosing a range using AUTO, LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH, the user now sets the actual maximum frequency that they want the dynamic notch to cover, using dyn_notch_max_hz. The dynamic notch will then help control noise between its minimum and maximum frequency values. The default dyn_notch_max_hz value of 600Hz works best for most quads, but can be tweaked. The optimal value depends on whether or not you're using rpm filtering, and the rpm range of the quad. If you were using LOW, dyn_notch_max_hz around 350hz should be roughly equivalent. If you were using HIGH, probably around 700hz will be enough, I've not seen many quads actually get much higher in rpm that that. When rpm filtering isn't being used, the dynamic notch needs to cover the full range of possible motor generated frequencies. The value required can be determined accurately by logging with debug GYROSCALED and looking at the highest frequency reported in spectral analysis. Alternatively it can be estimated as 70% of the peak theoretical no-load rpm. For example, a 2000KV motor with 6S has no load rpm of 2000 6 _ 4 = 48000 rpm. 70% of that is 33,600rpm, divide by 60 and you get 560hz. Slow fliers and X-class quads should use dyn_notch_max_hz at say 350-400hz, and a lower dyn_notch_min_hz than defaults. Lower maximum values will improve resolution over defaults. With rpm filtering, the motor noise lines usually get removed completely, and the dynamic notch has little to do. In many cases it can be turned off. However, it can be useful for attenuating residual noise or frame resonance. If there is no particular frame resonance, it will sort of hover around the middle of its range. With the defaults, this keeps it out of the way, causing relatively little delay. If there is a specific resonance at some particular frequency, the min and max values can be centered either side of the resonance line. For example, if you have 150hz resonance, try setting minimum to 100 and max to 200. No matter how low you set the max value, the value used internally will never be less than twice the minimum value. This is necessary to ensure the code works properly. The 4.1 tuning guide notes about notch width and Q factor still apply... in short, when using the rpm filter: set dyn_notch_width_percent = 0 set dyn_notch_q = 250  And this restores the default values for use without RPM filtering set dyn_notch_width_percent = 8 set dyn_notch_q = 120  "},{"title":"Iterm Relax works properly in setpoint mode​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Betaflight 4.2 Tuning Notes","url":"/docs/tuning/4.2-Tuning-Notes#iterm-relax-works-properly-in-setpoint-mode","content":"There was a bug in 4.0 and 4.1 that affected of iterm relax setpoint mode. Setpoint mode worked fine with defaults, but changing the iterm_relax_cutoff had almost no effect. Gyro mode of iterm_relax was not affected. That's why bounce back seemed to be better controlled by lowering iterm_relax_cutoff in gyro mode only. Now, setpoint mode works correctly for all iterm_relax_cutoff values. We recommend that most users go back to setpoint mode in 4.2. When tuning iterm_relax_cutoff, to reduce I mediated bounce back after a flip or roll, aim for highest value consistent with adequate bounce back control. To be sure that bounce-back in a freestyle quad is I related, and not due to something else, temporarily set iterm_relax_cutoff to a high value, eg 40, and make a test flight. If the bounce-back definitely worsens, reduce the iterm_relax_cutoff value until it is adequately controlled. For most GoPro carrying modern freestyle quads, lowering iterm_relax_cutoff to around 10 should be enough. For 7&quot; builds perhaps 5-7. X Class may need 5 or less.

Credits at the end of the page. New PID based tuning sliders - Whether you need to tweak the tune or build it from scratch, we now have simpler, more comprehensive, firmware based tuning sliders in the Configurator. These are active by default. Slider positions are stored with the quad, and can be modified via the OSD or LUA. New expert sliders allow fine-tuning of Pitch:Roll balance, DMax:Dmin, and I relative to P. Presets - A fantastic, comprehensive new preset system! Whether a whoop, a twig, a 5&quot; racer, a freestyle setup, or an X-class, you can now easily apply a great tune for your quad, out of the box. Presets also exist for radio setups, vtx configurations, and so on. Users can choose from 'official' Betaflight Presets and 'community' presets. Both are checked by Betaflight developers. Access to external Preset repositories is also provided, but take care when using these, since Betaflight has no control over their content. Less gyro filtering with higher P and D, providing better 'out of the box' performance. We've changed how D is configured. We now have Derivative and D_Max settings. The Derivative value is what sets the D value in smooth flying. When you turn fast, D rises to Dmax, providing more effective damping for fast movements, and when going straight, D back to Derivative and reduce D noise and motor heat. The difference between the two values has been reduced, and the Derivative value is significantly higher. Unlike 4.2, you usually won't need to push the D slider higher, unless you are seeking stronger straight-line stability in a clean HD or cinematic build. More accurate loop times - We've made massive scheduler and DMA code improvements, including EXTI triggered SPI gyro reads (on supported boards), giving super stable looptimes, smoother filter performance, faster logging and improved CPU efficiency. NOTE: The CPU load reported in 4.3 is higher than reported in 4.2 due to a change in the way it is calculated. It now reports the % of time that the processor is busy running tasks, rather than a figure based on load average. Multi dynamic notch - We have a completely rewritten, much improved, SDFT based multi-dynamic notches. More than one resonant peak can be tracked at the same time, more accurately and more quickly than before, with low latency cost. This allows for lower overall low pass filtering and better performance. The above two changes have significantly improved incoming 'gyro noise'. This has allowed us to push the default gyro filtering higher than before. Coupled with higher D, this improves propwash. Many quads can now fly with the gyro filter slider hard right. PT3 based RC smoothing - RC smoothing has been completely revised, and is now entirely filter based, using optimised PT3 (third order) smoothing. RC Smoothing now has the ideal filter shape applied with no overshoot and very smooth response. The auto smoothing value provides anything from low-latency to exceptional buttery cinematic smoothness. RPM crossfading - we now can smoothly disable overlapping RPM filtering notches entirely at low RPM. This greatly reduces filter delay at low throttle. You’ll hear an immediate difference in the sound of the motors, and experience less propwash around low throttle. PT2 and PT3 lowpass filtering options - The old biquad lowpass filter option is no longer available on Gyro, due to delay, overshoot and resonance issues. Previous Gyro biquad lowpass users should change to PT2, but more likely will find that, in 4.3, single or dual first order filtering is optimal for Gyro. Biquad filtering is still available for D, where a harder cut than PT2 can be useful. Feedforward jitter reduction - 4.3 introduces feedforward jitter reduction, which is an improvement on feedforward transition. It delivers a ‘dynamic transition’ effect to the feedforward, where you can get silky smooth responses while making slow stick inputs, and immediate, snappy feedforward responses to quick inputs. Usually, Transition is not required any more. Jitter reduction provides the Transition type effect, but at any stick angle. Jitter reduction also attenuates RC link noise during slow movements, especially for the newer higher rate Rx links. Racers will tend to use lower jitter reduction values than Freestylers, since that will attenuate link noise without delaying stick responses. Other feedforward improvements - We now have second order smoothing on boost, soft interpolation during slow stick moves, and more accurate duplicate packet interpolation. Most slower radio links won't need averaging, which is now off by default. High speed radio links (250hz and higher) will typically benefit from 2 point averaging and stronger smoothing. Presets to suit most common link types make Radio link configuration easy. AntiGravity improvements - P boost has been added, along with I boost timing optimisation to peak when it is most needed. This provides greater stability during rapid throttle changes. The default value of 3.5 should not be increased without careful testing. Dynamic gyro filter expo curve - Adjusting filter expo curves improves propwash by raising dynamic gyro filter cutoff values more quickly as you throttle up. Improved dynamic idle - The dynamic idle code has been heavily revised, and can now keep RPM at a more stable value, more quickly and more precisely than before, and can be fine-tuned with its new single sided PID controller. It is now much simpler to set up. There is no need to measure RPM or change your D_Shot idle percentage value - leave that value at your normal setting. Just enable DShot Telemetry (and check it is working), and set a suitable idle RPM value in the PID Tuning page. Typically 3000-4000 rpm works great. This improves motor spin-up-from-low-rpm behaviour, enhancing low throttle input responsiveness, and reduces the risk of desyncs, while allowing motor drive to go all the way to zero for enhanced braking when appropriate and for longer inverted hang times. Linear and Dynamic mixer options - These are alternatives to the stock Betaflight mixer code. The dynamic option may result in less aggressive bump and landing responses for level mode or cinematic flights. Feedforward in Level and Horizon Modes - Feedforward is now active in Horizon, Level, and Level Race modes, leading to quicker level mode angle changes, and making Horizon mode as responsive as Acro for flips and other fast moves. The amount of feedforward in these modes can be adjusted and saved in the profile, like for the other PID parameters. Actual Rates is the new Betaflight default - Actual rates provide a simpler and more intuitive way to set your Rates, and are now the default. Default rates are less aggressive in the center, but more progressive around mid-stick, than the previous defaults. Full-stick default max roll rate is the same as before. Betaflight rates are optional and can still be used. Take care when updating! If you copy and paste your old rates values, be sure to copy and paste the rates type also! Use this calculator to convert your old rates to Actual rates. CrossfireV3 and Ghost RC link improvements - As well as support for the latest Crossfire, ELRS and Ghost protocols, the internal betaflight RC code now supports 12bit or higher RC data in a float data path, handles very low RC Links (down to 16hz) better than before, fully supports high speed links to 1000hz, and better attenuates feedforward glitches when the RC link returns after dropouts. ELRS over SPI support for ELRS V2 on-board receivers. Many thanks to Phobos and the other ELRS devs for helping make this happen. FrSky OSD fix - Asizon fixed it! Lua script updates - we now have RSSI in your OSD via LUA, Slider control from the radio, and lots of other changes. Changed CLI command names - many CLI parameters are re-named. As a result, a lot of copy and paste efforts will fail to make all the changes you intended. Using the CLI 'get' command now finds related values more easily. For example, get gyro_lp will find all gyro lowpass filter settings, get feed will find all feedforward values, etc. **4.3 should fly really well on defaults. Start there, or with a Preset that suits your purposes. Most likely if there is a good match for your hardware, the Preset will fly great, with no additional adjustments. Advanced tuners can experiment with the easy slider tuning, and use sliders at the field via OSD or LUA.

Random wobbles at the end of some, but not all, flip or rolls, especially the faster ones towards the end of the flight, are usually caused by delayed motor start-up from excessively low idle, being over-propped, or weak ESC startup from low RPM (48kHz or dynamic ESC modes).

If you never turn fast, you may be able to get higher P than otherwise.if the quad lacks authority, attenuate I using the expert mode I adjustment slidermake sure the ADC is not ticked in the hardware settings of OpenTx!!make sure the frame is super stiff and nothing is able to wobble or flap aroundbe sure your capacitor is bigsometimes the gyro chip isn't working properly, and some ESCs just don't play nice, if all else fails, try changing these parts from a quad that does fly perfectly.use a jitter reduction factor of 10-12.

If there is no change, feed-forward isn't the problem, and can be used at normal settings.high level RC smoothing (auto smoothing of 90 or higher) will attenuate the erratic behaviour of old gimbals or 'thumb shake'. To test whether your RC link is the problem, temporarily set a wide deadband. We don't recommend deadband much, but a high deadband test will eliminate all random noise on the RC link, when sticks are centered.

They provide a very quick and simple way to tune the quad, whether at the field or at your computer. Slider positions are now stored in the flight controller, and can be updated via the OSD or Lua, at the field. P and D are now set independently with their own specific sliders. No more P:D ratio and P&amp;D gain. Basic mode users only see the three most important sliders (PI, D and Feedforward), with limited adjustment range. Expert mode shows additional allow fine-tuning sliders for I, Dmax, and pitch:roll ratio for D and P, and overall master gain. When an Expert mode slider is not at its default position, or a Basic slider is outside the basic adjustment range, it is visible, but greyed out, in basic view. To adjust a 'greyed out' slider, switch to Expert view. P:D ratio can, approximately, be retained by moving both PI and D sliders together, keeping similar relative positions The master gain slider can be used to increase or decrease overall PID strength, keeping everything in exact proportions Sliders are ON by default. Numeric parameter entry is blocked in Configurator when Sliders are controlling a value. If you want to use the older non-slider method of direct number entry, you MUST first disable the Sliders by setting them OFF. The normal PID slider ON mode is RPY. This means all three axes, Roll, Pitch and Yaw, are controlled. If the quad requires special Yaw settings, you can choose RP mode, and use direct numeric entry for yaw alone. The balance and overall strength of P and D is now visually obvious from their respective slider positions. WARNING: Do not make manual changes to the PID or lowpass numbers when Sliders are enabled! Turn the Slider/s OFF first (most easily done in Configurator. CAUTION: When using Sliders in Configurator, be sure to make your on-field tuning changes using Sliders also! If you change numeric values using the CLI, OSD or LUA, while Sliders are active, you can create conflicting slider and number setups. If you save numbers, you can fly those numbers - they won't go away. But, if you save PIDs or Filters from a screen where Sliders are ON, your custom values will be over-written by those calculated from the Sliders. They will just vanish. Hence, it's really important to avoid these conflicts. If you use Sliders, stick with them, tune with them at the field, and don't use the numbers. If you want to use numbers, disable the sliders. We're confident that these sliders will work effectively for both beginners and experienced tuners. They simplify the transition from 'basic' to 'expert' tuning methods. Most people, experienced tuners included, should now be able to use the sliders for nearly all their tuning requirements, both on and off the field.

The following are common indications, while increasing D, that it's time to drop back a bit: motors getting hot,we hear grinding or humming sounds on armingthe quad noisily 'flies to the moon' on armingbent props make the motors really hot really quickly We know that the primary limit on how much D you can run is how clean the build is. Builds with good bearings, well balanced and well centered motors, stiff frames, stiff props, etc, will accept more D. Different props or ESC settings can have an influence. Once you've set D as high as it can reasonably go, bring P up until something bad happens, e.g.: a fluttering sound from P oscillation in hard mid to high throttle turns, orunder-damped short duration overshoots or resonances in step responses, orstraight out P oscillation.

We then bring P back until there is a bare hint of that wobble, and gradually bring D up, stepwise, as much as we can, but usually not higher than P, in an attempt to block that residual wobble. We may be limited in how much D we can apply, by motor heat or noise. If we do control the wobble, we can sometimes bring P one click higher, and again add a click or two of D to see if we can control that.

If a task takes longer to execute than predicted, then other vital tasks will be late. This was frequently the case in 4.2 especially for the RX and OSD tasks. Tasks in 4.3 are restructured to increase the probability of them completing within the expected time, so that the scheduler can make better scheduling decisions. In 4.3 it's best to run F405 and F411 boards at 4k, not 8k, if RPM filtering is enabled. For F411 processors this is enforced. F411's may be overclocked to 120Mhz.. They don't run hot like F405's, most run perfectly well at 120Mhz. Some may be erratic at 120Mhz, but OK at 108Mhz, perhaps depending on the grade of the chip used on the board or other board related factors; if they are more stable at 108Mhz, use that.

The processor read data from the gyro in the gyro task using polled access, which means it had to wait for the read to complete, unable to do anything else.The MPU6000 gyro has irregular updates. Every 8th update takes not 125us, but 170us, followed by another of 80us. As a result the gyro task would occasionally read two samples, 125us apart, within the 170us interval and miss the update in the 80us cycle completely.Because the gyro update rate and the gyro loop were asynchronous, there was a random delay of up to 125us between the gyro data being updated (in the gyro) and the data being received and read/processed by the flight controller. In 4.3, these issues are fixed, by: Transferring data using Direct Memory Access (DMA), where the processor initiates the transfer and can do other things while waiting for the data transfer to complete. This will reduce CPU load.Syncing the scheduler to gyro updates, using a hardware interrupt line from the gyro to the flight controller. This FC pin used is set by the GYRO1_EXTI resource. When this sync is active, we reliably capture every single gyro update.Reading data from the gyro immediately after being notified by EXTI that an update is available, and processing the data a consistent amount of time afterwards. A hardware external interrupt line from gyro to FC is required to synchronise the gyro updates to the FC. Not all boards have this. Not all boards can use DMA for gyro data requests. The status CLI command reports dma in the Gyros detected line if DMA is being used (benefit 1 above), and if the gyro is locked to the FC by EXTI (benefits 2 and 3 above), it will show locked. For example, with both DMA and locked you will see: Gyros detected: gyro 1 locked dma  For more details see PR #10525, PR #10573, PR #10813 and PR #11033.

The user can specify up to 5 notches per axis. Usually no more than two or three are needed, depending on the build, and often only one. The SDFT tracks noise sources much more effectively than before. The code is completely different. It has been optimised to control resonance problems when used in association with RPM filtering. The RPM filter is still best for RPM related noise. Q values around 300-450 work well for freestyle applications. Keeping the minimum value as high as practical (eg 200hz), and only using the minimum number of notches, will minimise notch related filter 'delay'. To tune the dynamic notch properly, make a log with the dynamic notch off, do a spectrum analysis and see if there is resonance that needs to be controlled, and what the resonant frequencies are. Set the dynamic notch range to include the resonant peaks including 20hz additional range each side of the noise so as to be sure to fully filter the necessary frequencies. Then fly again, and check that the incoming resonance lines have gone from your gyro traces. Then repeat with higher Q values to find the highest Q value that adequately control those resonances. For quads that cannot run RPM filtering, the SDFT code will work reasonably effectively if configured with three or four notches and Q values around 120-150. These wider notches help account for rapidly changing center frequencies of motor frequency driven oscillations observed by the gyro, as the multi dynamic notch cannot respond as quickly as the bidirectional DShot driven RPM filter notches, but do perform remarkably well on a wide variety of craft. The multi dynamic notch can still be used alongside static notches applied to gyro and D-Term values. Static notches work best at targeting constant frequency resonance. If you find you have a strong constant frequency resonance you may be required to apply a narrow static notch over the frequency resonance in the gyro or D Term to capture any residue noise left over from SDFT. For craft with specific known static frequencies, such as frame resonance, a manually added static notch with the correct cutoff should outperform the multi-dynamic notch, and also allow for using the multi dynamic notch frequency range of regard to be larger. If a craft has a specific resonance that is present at exactly one frequency across the entire throttle and flight condition envelope, adding static notch and reducing the multi dynamic notch count by one is a recommendation. Adjusting the range of the multi dynamic notch does result in adjusting the bin sizes that the SDFT algorithm uses, although as second quadratic estimation step is included that centers each dynamic notch on the most accurate estimate of center frequency using data from both adjacent bins. Increasing the range between the MinHz value and MaxHz value will trade off some resolution for a wider frequency range of regard, and can have the dynamic notch system respond faster to changes in frequency, which can be helpful in suppressing quickly changing resonances at higher frequency.

Cinematic or HD pilots can now get amazingly smooth results that were impossible before. The old linear interpolation method has been removed because the PT3 filter-based method works better (no overshooting, lower latency, better tunability). We very strongly recommend keeping rc smoothing 'on' at all times - ie with set rc_smoothing = ON. If you turn it off, your motors will get very notchy drive signals, run hotter and noisier, and lower link speeds will shake the quad at link frequency. The auto smoothing algorithm hasn't changed, It detects your RC link speed on arming, sets the RC smoothing cutoffs automatically, and changes their values if the link speed changes in-flight (though it takes a while to do so). The default auto smoothing value is now 30, which gives a reasonably well-smoothed setpoint line and very little delay when compared to the un-smoothed signal. For HD freestyle, an auto value of 60 will provide greater smoothness and not a whole lot of extra delay. For cinematic video, where absolute smoothness is needed, auto values around 90-120 will give that silky effortless smoothness you are after, at the cost of obvious stick delay. In association with jitter reduction and feedforward smoothing, most cinematic footage will be incredibly smooth. The auto smoothing function adjusts the filters to give the least delay for the given link speed. At higher link speeds, the smoothing filters run faster, and give quicker stick responses. For cinematic flying with a fast radio link, and for crossfire in a non-locked mode, it may be best to manually over-ride the auto smoothing, to get a consistent amount of smoothness throughout the flight, and across builds with different radio links. This can be done by by setting fixed, non-auto, values in the CLI. For cinematic purposes, 10-15hz works well, regardless of link speeds. This snippet should work: set rc_smoothing_setpoint_cutoff = 10 set rc_smoothing_feedforward_cutoff = 10  The same applies to non-locked crossfire, which can swap between 50Hz and 150Hz, randomly. Here a value of 20-30hz will give reasonably consistent stick feel and reasonable smoothness even in 50hz mode: set rc_smoothing_setpoint_cutoff = 25 set rc_smoothing_feedforward_cutoff = 25  We generally don't advise going below 30 for auto smoothness, though at high link speeds, eg 250 or 500hz, a value of 20 may be good for racing, by keeping delay to the absolute minimum. There will be some transfer of the RC link frequencies into your motors, but not much. If you can hear a difference, or your motors run warmer, go back to 30. In most cases, stick with the default auto smoothing, and once you've decided on your radio link speed, or after changing radios, adjust the auto smoothing value to get the result your after. RC smoothing value for throttle is independently adjustable, automatically or manually. Its best left at 30, unless you are a high link speed racer and want to try 20. To avoid throttle jumps on a cinematic build, go higher, but be wary of throttle lag when you need to pull up from a dive :-) RC smoothing is now applied equally to setpoint and feedforward in Auto mode. The log header will show the actual frequencies being used with your link. In the CLI you can manually configure the amount of smoothing on feedforward relative to setpoint. Testing to date has not shown this option to be clearly useful, in any practical sense, and likely it will be removed down the track. It makes more sense to control stepping in feedforward by using feedforward smoothing (feedforward_smooth_factor); heavy RC smoothing on feedforward is ineffective against link jitter and will add a lot of delay.

Basically we now can have the RPM filtering benefits when we need them, with none of the drawbacks when they are not needed. We discovered that notch filters operate by generating an 'anti-noise' signal at their specified cutoff frequency. They don't generate 'delay' in the conventional sense. Not in the same way that a lowpass filter does. They make a signal which, when mixed with the original, 'cancels out' the noise in the original signal. This means that we can attenuate a notch filter in a linear fashion, by 'cross-fading', or 'mixing', it's 'anti-noise' signal in, or out, like an audio mixer. This is extremely useful for RPM filtering. Previously, when any motor went below the minimum RPM frequency, its three RPM notches would all remain active, but be held at their minimum frequency. While there was no noise to remove, they generated 'delay' and reacted to nearby frequencies, and causing a form of intermodulation distortion, and worsening propwash. Now, we can essentially 'turn the RPM filters off' when they aren't needed, and bring them back on smoothly over a 'cross-fade' range above the minimum rpm value. Once the rpm filters are completely 'off', they cause no delay or interference of any kind, resulting in cleaner and better gyro traces than before. In most builds, significant RPM related noise doesn't start to happen until about 100hz (6000 rpm). So we can start the RPM filtering at say 80hz and cross-fade it over 50hz, so that by 130hz, or 10,000 rpm, you have full RPM filtering active again. eg: set rpm_filter_min_hz = 80 set rpm_filter_fade_range_hz = 50  We have found a cross-fade range of 50hz to be optimal in most cases. The default minimum RPM value, where RPM first starts to 'switch on', at 80hz, also works well for most quads. Machines with very clean props and very little intrinsic RPM noise can have this value shifted higher, eg set rpm_filter_min_hz = 100 set rpm_filter_fade_range_hz = 70  Very large quads with low RPM we would choose proportionally lower values since they operate at low RPM. Tuning for Crossfade requires enabling the dshot_telemetry debug, doing some smooth steady throttle-ups, from zero to 50%, with no other stick inputs, and then add throttle cuts. It's best to set PIDs low with heavy filtering on D to take out D noise. Using the debug traces, look at the point where the motor RPM falls into the cross-fade region, and see if motor RPM related noise is getting into the gyro trace. If the minimum rpm is set too high, you'll get significant motor noise leaking through the crossfade region. If you're not sure what you're seeing, set the cross-fade minimum very high. This will effectively disable RPM filtering at lower RPM and let the noise through. If you set the minimum with a very low crossfade value, eg 10; there will be a sudden change when the rpm filtering kicks in. The minimum should be set to a point below where rpm noise becomes an issue, and the crossfade range can be extended upwards until it too allows some, but not too much bleed-through, in the upper cross-over region. The goal is the highest values consistent with reasonable attenuation of the motor noise.

Perfect for smooth fast racing and for 'flick' freestyle inputs. It completely removes the need to use the old Dterm/feedforward 'transition' function, which provided feedforward attenuation only when sticks are centered. This provides similar attenuation at any position while the sticks are still, or moving slowly. Feedforward, especially with boost, is known as the 'stick responsiveness' parameter, and for good reason. It provides a strong and immediate reaction to stick inputs. A good amount of feedforward (say 120-130) will make the quad super responsive, without adding overshoot. It gives those 'snap' freestyle inputs extra zing, and gives race pilots near-zero setpoint-to-gyro lag. However, it accentuates even the tiniest of RC inputs, and can make for twitchy flight and jerkiness in HD video. It doesn't matter if those RC twitches come from nervousness, slightly sticky or noisy gimbals, RC link connection problems, they all get exaggerated by feedforward... Until now. The 'old' way to handle these 'jitters' was to use feedforward transition, which linearly attenuated feedforward down to zero when your sticks were close to the center position. This solved the problem of 'too much feedforward' at center stick position - but nowhere else. Transition has a number of limitations. It only works when the sticks are centered; if you are in a smooth turn, with sticks off-center, but still, you want smooth flight also. However transition is much less effective in this setting. Also, when moving the sticks across the center, in a smooth move, transition will cut the feedforward out abruptly at center, causing a wobble, worst with narrow transition ranges. If you do make the transition range wide, all feedforward benefit is lost in the middle, and 'snap flicks' become hard to achieve. Jitter reduction attenuates feedforward strongly when the sticks are moving slowly, regardless of their absolute position. Think of it as a kind of 'dynamic transition' function. The default jitter_reduction_factor of 7 works best for most quads with normal radio links, and is suitable for racing, ensuring that tight turns, and high-speed straights, are both smooth and responsive. Experienced race pilots with higher speed links will find that the straight-line sensitivity will be a bit less than normal, because for very small inputs, their feedforward 'push' is attenuated. They may prefer a value of 5. After a few flights we find that the quad 'stays on the intended line' a fair bit better than before, especially during tighter turns, which feel more 'on rails' than before. A value of 12-15 pretty much removes all feedforward from slow smooth inputs, and is what we suggest for freestyle/cinematic. The quad will be equally smooth in straight centered flight and in a sustained tight turns. However, if you flick the sticks, the response will be immediate. How it does this magic is simple, in principle. We look at how much the RC command values change from packet to packet, average the two most recent change amounts, and compare that average to a user-configured threshold. We then fade out the feedforward values when the recent rate of RC change is below the threshold. But when the RC command changes are bigger than the threshold, we let feedforward through, unchanged and without any delay, to give immediate snap responses when we move the sticks quickly. The jitter_reduction_factor value is the threshold for the RC Command change, in tenths of a percent of stick travel, below which feed-forward is attenuated. A value of 10 means feedforward will be attenuated progressively for RC command changes of less than 1% per step. Attenuation below the threshold follows a kind of exponential curve, so that with a value of 10, there will be barely 10-20% of the normal feedforward for rcCommand change steps of 0.1% to 0.2% of the full RC range. Both link frequency and link bit depth have an impact on a suitable jitter reduction value. At low link frequencies, eg 50hz, most RC steps are large, and there really isn't much of a jitter issue to worry about. So the defaults and the suggested freestyle values actually do OK for 50hz to 150hz. Higher link speeds, 250Hz and above, run into a problem where there is only a limited number of steps available, and not much time for a change to be detected. Crossfire and FrSky protocals only provide 800 steps across the full RC range, or only 400 steps from center to max position. If the pilot moves the stick slowly over one second to max, some RC steps will be one, and others two, packets high. Small steps like that vary by 100% from step to step, leading to a lot of jitter in feedforward, which thinks that the sticks are shaking massively. The person's intrinsic jitter and the gimbal itself makes jitter noise of at least this magnitude, and feedforward would ordinarily amplify it - just like D amplifies gyro noise. This is where the jitter reduction code helps remove that residual noise in higher speed links; its kind of like a dynamic, zero delay filter, applied to feedforward when the signal to noise ratio would be bad. It applies first order filtering to the simple setpoint derivative and second order filtering to the boost element. Hence the jitter reduction system markedly reduces gimbal jitter on all systems, but is most effective, and important, in higher link rate systems with only 800 steps. For that reason we suggest keeping it at the default value on all RC links, increasing it for freeestyle and cinematic, and maybe dropping back to 5 but only on clean RC links for race purposes. The newer 11 and 12 bit RC link protocols with 2000 steps will provide better resolution, however gimbal noise will remain a problem, and hence the jitter reduction code is likely to remain needed for the forseeable future.

A bug that limited its usefulness has been fixed. The default value of 90 works best for most quads. Under-powered quads may need 100. Duplicate packet interpolation has been improved. Since duplicates occur frequently at slow stick movement speeds, we now use the jitter reduction value to attenuate the interpolation process, so that we interpolate very little when the sticks are moving very slowly.

It improves desync resistance and low throttle authority. Do not follow the old 4.2 instructions. You don't need to measure RPM in the motors tab any more. All you have to do is: enable DShot Telemetrygo to the PID tuning tab and set Dynamic Idle Min RPM to a value between 30 and 40 (ie, a minimum idle speed of 3000 to 4000 RPM). NOTES: If DShot Telemetry is enabled, but it isn't working properly, you won't be able to arm.DShot Telemetry must be enabled for RPM filtering or Dynamic Idle to work.If DShot Telemetry is not enabled, Dynamic Idle will be disabled, and the 'static' DShot Idle percentage will be used.When Dynamic Idle is active, DShot Idle is rendered inactive, and is greyed out.There is no need to adjust DShot Idle to use Dynamic Idle.

On arming, and until airmode is active, you will not get the full Dynamic Idle minimum RPM. Your motors won't spin super fast on first arming, because there is a limit on the drive to the motors until Airmode activates. Dynamic Idle therefore acts as a kind of sophisticated 'idle up' function that provides all the benefits of the old manual in-flight idle-up switches, but without the drawbacks. With high minimum RPM, the motors retain RPM at all times, leading to more responsiveness at zero throttle, cleaner flips and rolls, and neater turns. At high values, the slowest motors will provide thrust during flips, rather than almost stalling, and the quad will tend to perform a kind of circle in the sky. The same happens on 180 degree turns, which become little arcs. Also, with high minimum RPM high, the quad will be slower to lose altitude in 'right-side-up' flat throttle chops, because the motors will generate some upwards thrust all the time. This isn't all that bad, and will also enhance stability and authority in these moves, which can otherwise suffer badly from propwash. In both cases, high minimum RPM helps avoid propwash since you tend to always move through clean air; this make a lot of sense when flying freestyle or fast racing. With high minimum RPM, a big punch upwards followed by a 180 turn to inverted, and a hard throttle cut, will not float upwards quite as high, because the motors will deliver more downwards thrust because RPM will be higher than otherwise. However, when the quad starts falling downwards, and the airflow into to the props allows dynamic idle to cut drive to the motors, the motor drive can fall to zero, and the inverted hang should be not much different from usual. For maximum inverted hang time, and probably for Line Of Sight flying, use the lowest minimum RPM value that avoids desyncs. Most users with desync-prone setups will find that Dynamic Idle solves their problems. As you move the minimum RPM upwards, the chance of a desync decreases, and vice versa. If Dynamic Idle doesn't work for you, set it to zero and you will revert to the static DShot Idle Percent method. The new code is so good that many of my quads can fly with only 1000 rpm as a minimum dynamic idle RPM. The prop blades are visible turning slowly during LOS flips and rolls, but they don't desync. I wouldn't recommend going that low unless you had a particular curiosity to see how low you can go. For most general freestyle or racing applications, a minimum RPM of 4000 usually works really well. Tuning: In place of the idle_adjustment_speed and idle_p tuning settings, we now have a PID controller. This provides more precise RPM control. Typically higher power quads will need lower P values, eg 40 for a strong 6S build, and those with lower authority may benefit from higher PID values. The best way to check RPM control stability is to log with the appropriate Debug, and do some flat drops at zero throttle. If the RPM value oscillates, try less P. If it is stable during the drop, but transiently drops below target on the chop, add more D and/or more P.

Anytime a motor might need to be driven 'below zero' in order to maintain authority, throttle is increased by airmode so that the requested motor differential can be achieved. This airmode-driven throttle increase is the only reason why we can flip and roll 'normally' at zero throttle. However, there are downsides. Airmode leads to strong reactions on impacts; the quad will get more throttle and climb. There is a fairly abrupt change in authority once the limits that Airmode can provide are reached. These alternate mixer models change the relative emphasis between throttle authority and PID control. They may have some use in smooth cinematic flying styles, providing a kind of partial airmode effect with less bounce on landing at the expense of limited low throttle PID performance in quicker moves. If interested, just fly and see if you like them or not.

In Level Mode, this results in a more immediate response when moving the sticks to change the angle of the quad. The quad should more promptly assume your new intended angle. In Horizon Mode, while flying aggressively, the behaviour is now nearly exactly the same as acro, with all the benefits that feedforward brings in terms of immediate stick response and reduced overshoot. It feels great! If you're a beginner and you find Level too twitchy, reduce the feedforward value in the PIDs.

See PR #10724 for graphs and more information. ACTUAL rates lets you set both the target center sensitivity and the maximum roll rate in degrees/second. The two values are independent of each other. Expo shifts the transition point between the two rates to be closer to center (at zero) or further out (at max). This online calculator allows visualisation of Betaflight rates vs Actual Rates. The new defaults are NOT exactly the same as the old Betaflight rates. Although the max rate is the same (670 deg/s), the new defaults are softer in the center (center sensitivity of 70, compared to about 200 in Betaflight's old defaults), and more responsive further out. See the image in the pull request. It is hoped that these will be easier to learn on and better suited to freestyle. Some experienced race pilots use 200deg/s center sensitivity and 620 max, with no expo. With the jitter reduction code, 200deg/s gives very quick turn-in but remains smooth and controllable in tight turns. Others prefer lower values. Betaflight rates users can use this rates calculator to find an Actual rates equivalent to what they currently fly. For instance, center of 200, max 670, and expo of 0.58 results in the original default Betaflight rates curve. If a user pastes in their Betaflight rates numbers from say a 'diff all', the rates_type information will not be included. The result will be that Actual Rates will be active, but with Betaflight CLI numbers. The quad will be un-flyable! That's why its a bad idea to copy and paste diff all's. Be sure to recreate your Rates manually, or, if you do a copy and paste, be sure to include the rates_type line from the CLI dump command when pasting your rates in.

Sometimes this was the case with Bosch gyros. However, we have learned that the Biquad can oscillate with step inputs and will overshoot some inputs with frequency content near cutoff. 4.3 no longer uses the Biquad for any lowpass filtering. Biquad filtering is still an option for both gyro and D lowpass filtering for those who feel it has specific benefit there. If your craft needed second order gyro filtering, we recommend the PT2 option, which works much the same as stacked PT1 filters, but with the cutoff adjusted to be correct. The PT2 filtering option provides less delay than the equivalent Biquad filter, though a bit less filtering, and is recommended to be used instead of the Biquad filter. PT3 filtering provides more filtering and delay than the equivalent Biquad filter and is not normally needed for gyro or D filtering. Compared to a PT1, filter delay increases by about 60% with a PT2 and doubles with a PT3.

You may need to set the proper rotation for each motor by wiring order for the motor, check the ESC manual to confirm. Full power negative will be at low stick and full power positive will be at full high stick. Center stick will be zero throttle. Switch arming is a must for 3D flight and can be set up in the Mode tab of the configuration GUI, motor_stop and stick arming do NOT work in 3D mode for obvious reasons.

Setup ESC to BIDIRECTIONAL MODE: Consult your ESC manual for how to enable bi-directional mode on your ESC. Set both max_throttle and min_command before calibrating the ESC. BL Heli ESC: (norm/reverse/birectional slider in BLHeli GUI) and set max pwm in the ESC GUI to the maximum your transmitter outputs on the throttle channel (normally 2000us) and min pwm to the minimum (normally 1000us) and the midpoint to halfway between (normally 1500us). The ESC will not ouput to the motors if its input is at the midpoint +/- a small deadband. Kiss 24A ESC: To teach the transmitter path (throttle path) the ESC / controller must be connected to a receiver or FC, set the throttle signal at full throttle (peak throttle).Connect the LiPo to the ESC / controller. A beep indicates the confirmation that the programming mode is activated. Now reduce the throttle signal to minimum (normally 1000μs,), and wait for the restart of the speed controller (audible signal high-low-high). The throttle pas is now programmed and the ESC/controller is ready for use. Caution: The loads, that arise for the ESC in the 3D mode, are up to 3 times higher! 3D mode: After the throttle travel has been programmed as described, the 3D mode can be activated as follows: Disconnect the power supply, put the transmitter signal at full throttle, connect power again, wait for beep. Adjusting the throttle to the middle position (half throttle path) and wait for restart of the ECS/ speed controller (signal: high-low-high). The 3D mode is now active. Important! speed controller now s tarts only at the throttle center position. Deactivation: Teach new master travel. Simon K ESC:Unlike BLHeli, SimonK firmware must be compiled specifically to support 3D mode. To program a SimonK ESC to support 3D mode, one must edit the appropriate firmware configuration file to enable the following feature : RC_PULS_REVERSE = 1 It is also recommended to disable stick calibration, as there is no way to reconfigure the mid_point at runtime. RC_CALIBRATION = 0 By default, SimonK sets the neutral throttle point (MID_RC_PULS) to halfway between minimum (STOP_RC_PULS, set to 1060), and maximum, (FULL_RC_PULSE, set to 1860) - so a value of 1460. You can change these values as you desire, but these defaults work well. MID_RC_PULS = = (STOP_RC_PULS + FULL_RC_PULS) / 2 The most common way to configure, compile, and flash SimonK esc's is using the KKFlash tool or the Chrome App &quot;RapidFlash&quot;. Both remove the complexity of building a compile environment for the Atmel MCU on the ESC. The RapidFlash tool is a bit easier to use than the KKFLash tool.  Setup the following parameters in the CLI: 3d_deadband_high: This is the lowest value for positive throttle output from the flight controller to the ESC when armed, the highest value for positive throttle output from the flight controller to the ESC when armed is max_throttle. The range between 3d_deadband_high and max_throttle is the total positive throttle output range. 3d_deadband_low: This is the lowest value for negative throttle output from the flight controller to the ESC when armed, the highest value for negative throttle output from the flight controller to the ESC when armed is min_command. The range between 3d_deadband_low and min_command is the total negative throttle output range. NOTE: To find values for 3d_deadband_high and 3d_deadband_low the motors tab in the configurator can be used to find the value closest to mid_rc which spins all motors consistently in each direction. These numbers should be fairly evenly spaced from mid_rc and should be set as close to mid_rc as possible with mid_rc being centered between the values for 3d_deadband_high and 3d_deadband_low in order to rotate the motors at identical speed in either direction while the throttle is centered. 3d_neutral: This is the output value from the flight controller to the ESC when disarmed. This is similar to how min_command works in normal mode, but for 3d operation. Unless you have a specific reason not to, failsafe_throttle should also be set to the same value as 3d_neutral. failsafe_throttle: This is the output value from the flight controller to the ESC once the failsafe conditions have been met. This should be set to the same value as 3d_neutral to cause the ESC to stop the motors under failsafe conditions. 3d_deadband_throttle: This is the throttle stick range around mid_rc which allows arming to occur, within this deadband the flight controller will output either 3d_deadband_high or 3d_deadband_low to the ESC. The value output (3d_deadband_high or 3d_deadband_low) is dependent on whether the throttle stick entered the deadband from a higher or lower value than mid_rc. max_throttle: This is the maximum value the flight controller will output to the ESC. ESC calibration should be performed after changing max_throttle. min_command: This is the minimum value the flight controller will output to the ESC. ESC calibration should be performed after changing min_command.

For most users all they need to do is simply configure the new mode to be active as desired on the &quot;Modes&quot; tab in the configurator and configure the desired angle limit in the cli. Configuration parameters: acro_trainer_angle_limit: (range 10-80) Angle limit in degrees. acro_trainer_lookahead_ms: (range 10-200) Time in milliseconds that the logic will &quot;look ahead&quot; to help minimize overshoot and bounce-back if the limit is approached at high gyro rates. The default value of 50 should be good for most users. For low powered or unresponsive craft (micros or brushed) it may be helpful to increase this setting if you're seeing substantial overshoot. acro_trainer_debug_axis: (ROLL, PITCH) The axis that will log information if debugging is active. acro_trainer_gain: (range 25-255) The angle limiting strength. Higher numbers can reduce overshoot, but can also lead to oscillation around the angle limit. The default value of 75 seems to work well for most situations. To enable debugging:set debug_mode = ACRO_TRAINER debug(0) - Current angledebug(1) - The internal logic statedebug(2) - Modified setpointdebug(3) - Projected angle based gyro rate and look-ahead period Note that there are no changes to the functioning or calculations in the PID controller. This feature simply intercepts the pilot input on the roll and pitch axes and adjusts to prevent exceeding the configured angle limit.","keywords":""},{"title":"Arming Sequence & Safety","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Arming-Sequence-And-Safety","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Switch arming​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Arming Sequence & Safety","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Arming-Sequence-And-Safety#switch-arming","content":"The AUX channel configured for arming will choose a default value that falls outside of the configured arm range (as configured in the &quot;Modes&quot; configurator tab), this value is either 1 &quot;step&quot; (25us) above or below the configured range.

With 3.2, this dependency/relationship has been removed. USE_BARO_xxx configures an I2C variant of the xxx and USE_BARO_SPI_xxx configures an SPI variant of xxx. If both specified, both I2C and SPI variants are configured. Right now, as inherited from 3.1.7, targets that use SPI connected barometer defines both USE_BARO_xxx and USE_BARO_SPI_xxx, so they are configured for both I2C and SPI variants, in which case, a run time selection will be the SPI variant as explained next. Default device determination (compile time)​ When a single barometer device is configured in the target definition, then the device will be the default device. When multiple barometer devices are configured in the target definition, then the following rule are applied sequentially to determine the default device.

The default is to be on, for all axes. It is unwise to disable this if your quad has an ICM gyro. It is not needed or helpful for MPU gyros. ICM gyros are susceptible to overflow-inversion problems if exposed to very high turn rates. If enabled and set to ALL, overflow protection will kick in and disable all PIDs whenever any axis exceeds 1950 degrees/second. yaw_spin_recovery = ONAllowed values: OFF, ON Yaw-Spin-Recovery-and-Gyro-Overflow-Detect This new feature, enabled by default in betaflight 3.4, reduces the severity and duration of un-commanded severe yaw spins. For example, if a quadcopter clips a gate, tree, branch or other object and causes a high rate yaw spin, it may go into a 'never-ending' uncontrollable spin. Typically it makes a distinctive warbling noise and climbs rapidly - the so-called Yaw Spin To The Moon (YSTTM) problem. 3.4 introduces two code features that should bring such spins under control more quickly and cleanly. Yaw Spin Recovery is intended primarily for FPV pilots, and works best with MPU gyros. LOS acro pilots who use high yaw rates may prefer to disable this function. yaw_spin_threshold = 1950Allowed range: 500 - 1950 The 'threshold' value is the spin rate, in degrees per second, at which the spin protection kicks in. The default threshold of 1950 was chosen to minimise false triggering. For FPV, a lower value, e.g. 100-200 above your maximum configured yaw rate, is recommended. For example, a quad with a maximum configured yaw rate of 700 degrees/sec: Too low a threshold may cause false triggering, and delay return to normal control. gyro_use_32khz = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON gyro_to_use = FIRSTAllowed values: FIRST, SECOND, BOTH dyn_notch_range = AUTOAllowed values: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, AUTO dyn_notch_width_percent = 8Allowed range: 0 - 20 dyn_notch_q = 120Allowed range: 1 - 1000 dyn_notch_min_hz = 150Allowed range: 1 - 1000 dyn_lpf_gyro_min_hz = 150Allowed range: 0 - 1000 dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz = 450Allowed range: 0 - 1000 align_acc = DEFAULTAllowed values: DEFAULT, CW0, CW90, CW180, CW270, CW0FLIP, CW90FLIP, CW180FLIP, CW270FLIP acc_hardware = AUTOAllowed values: AUTO, NONE, ADXL345, MPU6050, MMA8452, BMA280, LSM303DLHC, MPU6000, MPU6500, MPU9250, ICM20601, ICM20602, ICM20608G, ICM20649, ICM20689, BMI160, FAKE acc_lpf_hz = 10Allowed range: 0 - 400 acc_trim_pitch = 0Allowed range: -300 - 300 acc_trim_roll = 0Allowed range: -300 - 300 acc_calibration = 0,0,0Array length: 3 mid_rc = 1500Allowed range: 1200 - 1700 min_check = 1050Allowed range: 750 - 2250 max_check = 1900Allowed range: 750 - 2250 rssi_channel = 0Allowed range: 0 - 18 rssi_src_frame_errors = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON rssi_scale = 100Allowed range: 1 - 255 rssi_invert = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON rc_interp = AUTOAllowed values: OFF, PRESET, AUTO, MANUAL rc_interp_ch = RPYTAllowed values: RP, RPY, RPYT, T, RPT rc_interp_int = 19Allowed range: 1 - 50 rc_interp_ch = RPYTAllowed values: RP, RPY, RPYT, T, RPT rc_interp_int = 19Allowed range: 1 - 50 rc_smoothing_type = FILTERAllowed values: INTERPOLATION, FILTER Tuning-Tips-for-Betaflight-3.4#i-just-want-to-fly-not-read-all-this-stuffrc_smoothing_input_hz = 0Allowed range: 0 - 255 Spektrum-and-RC-Smoothing-Filter rc_smoothing_derivative_hz = 0Allowed range: 0 - 255 Spektrum-and-RC-Smoothing-Filter rc_smoothing_debug_axis = ROLLAllowed values: ROLL, PITCH, YAW, THROTTLE rc_smoothing_input_type = BIQUADAllowed values: PT1, BIQUAD rc_smoothing_derivative_type = BIQUADAllowed values: OFF, PT1, BIQUAD rc_smoothing_auto_smoothness = 10Allowed range: 0 - 50 fpv_mix_degrees = 0Allowed range: 0 - 90 max_aux_channels = 14Allowed range: 0 - 14 serialrx_provider = SPEK1024Allowed values: SPEK1024, SPEK2048, SBUS, SUMD, SUMH, XB-B, XB-B-RJ01, IBUS, JETIEXBUS, CRSF, SRXL, CUSTOM, FPORT serialrx_inverted = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON spektrum_sat_bind = 0Allowed range: 0 - 10 spektrum_sat_bind_autoreset = ONAllowed values: OFF, ON airmode_start_throttle_percent = 32Allowed range: 0 - 100 This keeps AirMode OFF until the the first time throttle reaches this value.

Note that there will be no protection against runaway takeoff events and the firmware will behave as it did before the feature was implemented. The remaining parameters affect the logic used to detect normal controlled flight and deactivate the feature for the remainder of the battery: runaway_takeoff_deactivate_delay This is the amount of successful flight time in milliseconds that must be accumulated to deactivate the feature. Valid values range from 100 (0.1 seconds) to 1000 (1 second). The default value of 500 (0.5 seconds) seems to be very reliable and shouldn't need to be adjusted. The goal is to deactivate the logic after a &quot;reasonable&quot; but short period of time once we've determined the craft is flying normally. However we want it to deactivate before we might reach the first point where a crash or other event may occur (like at the first gate during a race). Raising this value will delay the deactivation and it's possible that a crash or gate/branch clip could cause an unintended disarm. Lowering this value too much could result in the logic deactivating too soon and not providing protection in a runaway event. It's important to note that the delay is the accumulated amount of flight time where the other criteria like throttle level, stick activity, etc. are met. Thus the &quot;real&quot; elapsed time before deactivation may be longer than 0.5 seconds if the throttle was dropping below the limit or if the R/P/Y sticks were centered. The actual behavior can be viewed by using blackbox logging - see the debugging section below. runaway_takeoff_deactivate_throttle_percent Determines the minimum throttle percentage threshold where successful flight can be considered. Valid values range from 0 to 100. Along with throttle level the logic also requires activity on the roll, pitch or yaw sticks along with the PID controller successfully controlling the craft with the PID_sum staying under control. When these conditions are met the logic accumulates successful flight time. Generally you won't need to adjust this value as most quads require around 25% or more throttle to takeoff/hover. The exception may be if you have and extremely powerful or light craft that is capable of flying well below 25% throttle. In this case you may want to lower this value closer to your actual hover throttle percent. If this value is set too low it's possible that the logic will deactivate too quickly and may not trigger in a real runaway event. Setting it too high will result in the logic taking more flight time to deactivate as it only accumulates flight time when the throttle is above the setting. tlm_inverted = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON tlm_halfduplex = ONAllowed values: OFF, ON frsky_default_lat = 0Allowed range: -9000 - 9000 frsky_default_long = 0Allowed range: -18000 - 18000 frsky_gps_format = 0Allowed range: 0 - 1 frsky_unit = IMPERIALAllowed values: IMPERIAL, METRIC frsky_vfas_precision = 0Allowed range: 0 - 1 hott_alarm_int = 5Allowed range: 0 - 120 pid_in_tlm = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON report_cell_voltage = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON ibus_sensor = 1,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0Array length: 15 mavlink_mah_as_heading_divisor = 0Allowed range: 0 - 30000 ledstrip_visual_beeper = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON When set to on, and the LEDLOW mode is active (i.e. LED strip off), blink the LED strip in synch with beeping, as a visual indicator in cases where the craft is too far away for the beeper to be heard / multiple craft are flying. ledstrip_grb_rgb = GRBAllowed values: GRB, RGBhttps://betaflight.com/docs/development/LedStrip#ws2811-vs-ws2812 sdcard_detect_inverted = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON sdcard_mode = SPIAllowed values: OFF, SPI, SDIO sdcard_dma = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON sdcard_spi_bus = 2Allowed range: 0 - 3 osd_units = METRICAllowed values: IMPERIAL, METRIC osd_warn_arming_disable = ONAllowed values: OFF, ON osd_warn_batt_not_full = ONAllowed values: OFF, ON osd_profile = 1Allowed range: 1 - 3 system_hse_mhz = 8Allowed range: 0 - 30 task_statistics = ONAllowed values: OFF, ON debug_mode = NONEAllowed values: NONE, CYCLETIME, BATTERY, GYRO_FILTERED, ACCELEROMETER, PIDLOOP, GYRO_SCALED, RC_INTERPOLATION, ANGLERATE, ESC_SENSOR, SCHEDULER, STACK, ESC_SENSOR_RPM, ESC_SENSOR_TMP, ALTITUDE, FFT, FFT_TIME, FFT_FREQ, RX_FRSKY_SPI, RX_SFHSS_SPI, GYRO_RAW, DUAL_GYRO, DUAL_GYRO_RAW, DUAL_GYRO_COMBINE, DUAL_GYRO_DIFF, MAX7456_SIGNAL, MAX7456_SPICLOCK, SBUS, FPORT, RANGEFINDER, RANGEFINDER_QUALITY, LIDAR_TF, ADC_INTERNAL, RUNAWAY_TAKEOFF, SDIO, CURRENT_SENSOR, USB, SMARTAUDIO, RTH, ITERM_RELAX, ACRO_TRAINER, RC_SMOOTHING, RX_SIGNAL_LOSS, RC_SMOOTHING_RATE, ANTI_GRAVITY, DYN_LPF, RX_SPEKTRUM_SPI rate_6pos_switch = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON cpu_overclock = OFFAllowed values: OFF, 192MHZ, 216MHZ, 240MHZ pwr_on_arm_grace = 5Allowed range: 0 - 30 vtx_band = 4Allowed range: 0 - 5 0=user, 1=A, 2=B, 3=E, 4=F(Airwaves/Fatshark), 5=Raceband vtx_channel = 1Allowed range: 1 - 8 VTX-CLI-Settings vtx_power = 1Allowed range: 0 - 4 for SmartAudio: 0=25mW, 1=25mW, 2=200mW, 3=500mW, 4=800mW for TBS Unify Nano: 0=25mW, 1=25mW, 2=50mW for IRC-Tramp: 0=25mW, 1=25mW, 2=100mW, 3=200mW, 4=400mW, 5=600mW vtx_low_power_disarm = OFFAllowed values: OFF, ON, UNTIL_FIRST_ARM If ON and the flight controller is disarmed, the video transmitter output power will be set to its lowest value (vtx_power=1).

It was written by the JoeLucid, who wrote the DShot telemetry code that underpins all bidirectional DShot functionality, such as Dynamic Idle and RPM Filtering. JESC is free on L ESCs, but payment is required for H ESCs. 48khz and 96khz PWM versions are available.BlHeli-32 fully supports Bidirectional DShot in versions 32.7.0 and higherAM32 can also be flashed (but not readily un-flashed) to BlHeli-32 type ESCs, and also fully supports Bidirectional DShot.

When the Flight Controller knows the RPM of each motor, it can set notch filters at exactly the right frequency to remove that noise. We can also use that RPM information to dynamically control idle RPM, and prevent it dropping too low. This is the Dynamic Idle feature, which gives better protection against ESC desync than conventional idle. RPM based filtering gives better control over motor RPM related noise than was possible previously. Motors are cooler, bent prop tolerance is better, and full throttle sounds cleaner and often is faster. With RPM filtering, the dynamic notch filter can be narrower, reducing delay, and since it doesn't need to track motor rpm related noise, is now better at eliminating frame resonances. Configurator automatically makes these adjustments when RPM filtering is enabled or disabled. On clean quads, lowpass filter delay can usually be improved by moving cutoff frequencies higher or disabling some gyro filtering once RPM filtering is enabled. This should be done carefully, after reading the tuning guide.

No additional wiring or additional telemetry back-channel is needed. Each DSHOT frame from the FC gets acknowledged by a frame from the ESC containing the current eRPM. The FC uses the motor pole count to convert ERPM to RPM. RPM filtering is a bank of 36 notch filters on gyro and (optionally) on Dterm which use the RPM telemetry data to remove motor noise with surgical precision. By default it runs 12 notch filters each on pitch, roll, and yaw, covering the first 3 harmonics of each motor's noise signature. For RPM Filtering to work, the ESC must support the Bidirectional DShot protocol and Bidirectional DShot must be enabled in the CLI. These two features are supported by BetaFlight 4.1 and higher on all flight controllers, and most modern BLHeli_32 and BLHeli-S ESCs. Betaflight 4.0 is no longer supported. Here's a demo in flight.

Typically no 'tuning' is required. Although RPM filtering will remove nearly all motor noise, general 'junk' noise from bearings, wind and turbulence will not be removed by the RPM filters. Lowpass filtering will still be required to control those noise elements. Frame or prop resonances, which manifest as large fixed frequency noise lines, won't be removed by the RPM filters either; they are best managed by keeping the Dynamic Notch active. The Dynamic Notch needs to be reconfigured when RPM filtering is active, since it now no longer needs to eliminate motor noise. In 4.1, set the Dynamic Notch Filter Range to Medium, the Dynamic Notch Width Percent to 0 and the Dynamic Notch Q to 250. In 4.2 and higher, set the Dynamic Notch Count to 1 and Q to 500. In 4.3 Configurator will make these changes automatically. For existing builds that already fly well, don't change any filter settings for your first flights after enabling RPM filtering. If your motors are running cool and sounding good, you may well be able to reduce filter delay by reducing or removing some of the other filters. You may be able to: move gyro lowpass filtering to higher values.disable gyro lowpass 1 entirely (by setting its cutoff value to zero, or switching it off).increasing the Q factor on the RPM filter, making the RPM notches narrower and reducing delay. Above 750 is not recommended.reduce the number of Dynamic Notch filters (width = 0 for 4.1, count = 1 for 4.2 and higher).increase the Q factor of the Dynamic Notch filter (avoid going about 750).convert existing biquad filters, if any, to PT1s, Each of these actions lets more noise through the filter bank to the PIDs and then to the motors. Filters should only be changed one at a time. After each change, always do a test hover and and a short test flight. Listen to the motors carefully, and land quickly to confirm that your motors aren't getting too hot. Then repeat with a more solid flight, and again check motor temps on landing. Black box logging, before and after, and using PID Toolbox to look at the spectral graphs is very useful. Logging can help you decide which filters can be lifted, or aren't needed, and to check that you haven't suddenly gained too much extra noise after making a change. It's best to save a diff all listing of your starting filter settings before changing anything, so you can go back.

Disabling filters have fairly substantial effects and should only be done by people familiar with filtering. Generally it is safer to move filters up or down as a group, as described above. The following will disable the first gyro lowpass completely: set gyro_lowpass_hz = 0 set dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz = 0  We do not recommend disabling both gyro lowpass 1 and gyro lowpass 2 unless you are certain that the build is really clean. This will disable the second gyro lowpass completely: set gyro_lowpass2_hz = 0  Disabling D filters completely is not recommended. A minimum of two PT1 filters (as per the defaults) or one second order lowpass (biquad or PT2) are required by all quads. Reducing D filtering is very hazardous. It can be very easy to smoke your motors. If you do want to experiment with reduced D filtering, do so very cautiously.

In 4.3 the appropriate changes are actioned automatically when you enable or disable RPM filtering, greatly simplifying RPM filter setup. The following notes apply to 4.1 only: In 4.1, the Dynamic Notch range is, by default, set to AUTO mode, and uses the value of dyn_lpf_gyro_max_hz to select the frequency range over which the dynamic notch will operate. Because frame resonances usually happen in the LOW or MEDIUM dynamic notch range, it is best, when rpm filtering is used, to manually configure the Dynamic Notch on one of those ranges. If you know you have no frame resonances below 150hz, choosing MEDIUM will reduce delay and keep the dynamic notch higher. If you want the dynamic notch to stay above a certain minimum value, because you know you have no resonances below that value, set the dynamic notch minimum frequency accordingly (just below the resonance that you are targeting). For example, this snippet would let the dynamic notch run between 90 to about 330hz with a narrow single notch: set dyn_notch_range = LOW set dyn_notch_width_percent = 0 set dyn_notch_q = 200 set dyn_notch_min_hz = 90  This snippet would let the dynamic notch range from 180 to about 550hz with a narrow single notch: set dyn_notch_range = MEDIUM set dyn_notch_width_percent = 0 set dyn_notch_q = 200 set dyn_notch_min_hz = 180  If the resonance line is very narrow, you can likely get away with the dynamic notch Q of 250. Wider or more diffuse resonance bands may need a Q of 120-150. It is always best to compare spectrums with dynamic filter on or off to check exactly what it is doing. It is possible to turn the dynamic notch filter off altogether on stiff resonance-free builds, but this should be done with caution, and is best tested by before and after logging confirms that it is not contributing meaningfully to the end result.

For practical purposes, DShot 600 works well at all PID loop rates. Remember that for each frame sent there will now be a frame coming back, and between input and output frames there is a period of 25us to switch the line, DMA, and timers. The loop time selection needs to be low enough that given the DSHOT protocol rate both frames + 50 us fit into one gyro loop iteration. Both bidirectional DSHOT and the RPM filter are fairly CPU intensive and it is very important for the loop rates to be exactly on spot so that the filters get tuned to the right frequencies. It is recommended to run at 4k/4k with DShot 600 for your initial test flight. All DSHOT speeds should work at that loop rate. On F4, RPM telemetry costs about 3-4uS per motor per line direction change. Something around 24-32uS is required for the line direction switching both directions together. The RPM filter has 36 notch filters that get dynamically tuned at 1000Hz update frequency. 8k4k is good on most F405's; 8k8k is possible, but often needs overclocking. F411's will require over-clocking to run at 8k4k. F7's run 8k8k without problems. You may need to switch off any extended startup melody, since that may interfere with bidirectional DSHOT.

More details on phase shift for example can be found here: https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/668 Post by r.a.v. You can view earlier BB logs (pre BF 3.0) but the analyzer won't know at which rate it was recorded. This will probably result in a correct looking spectrum but with incorrect frequency labels. Clicking on the traces on the Graph section to the right will show the analyzer screen. Post by ctzsnooze: Remember the spectrum is a relative comparator of the frequencies in the noise spectrum. It won't tell you about the absolute amount of noise. It can only be compared to other traces, and even then only when A fixed and comparable amount of vertical gain is setThe horizontal scale is set to be comparable to other tracesmost important the duration of the data to be analyzed is fixed. ie 30s. use the i and o keys to select a 30s realm for example. The most important thing is to scroll through and look at the motors traces for how big that noise is. The spectrum is useful for analyzing what you see there, but the motor trace and how it looks is what matters. See Gyro and Filters for more info. "},{"title":"The Spectral data is accumulative which means the longer the time frame of a log the higher the noise in the spectra;l display will be.

Answer from ctzsnooze: The filtering sequence for P is gyro lpf -&gt; gyro notch 1 -&gt; gyro notch 2 -&gt; P. For D it is gyro lpf -&gt; gyro notch 1 -&gt; gyro notch 2 -&gt; Dterm LPF -&gt; D notch -&gt; D Disabling all three notch filters means that they are gone. The gyro data goes into the PID loop without any attenuation from the notches. Frequencies that might otherwise have been filtered out by the notches will now be amplified by the PID loop. What you see in the gyro, P, D and motor spectrums is how your quad actually behaves when they aren't there at all. Set debug_mode = notch keeps the notch filters active, but records a version of the gyro trace from just after the gyro LPF - before the notch filters are implemented. The P, D and motor traces will be affected by the notches, because they are still active. Because they remain active, PID related noise amplification at those frequencies will be attenuated, reducing the amount of noise in those regions even in the pre-notch gyro trace. It just doesn't show what it would be like with no notch filters. Disabling a notch filter completely is the only way to really know what the noise state of the machine is like without it. Set debug_mode = notch isn't nearly as useful, that's why I don't recommend using it for this purpose. "},{"title":"Tuning Tips using BB logs​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Blackbox Logging And Usage","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Black-Box-logging-and-usage#tuning-tips-using-bb-logs","content":"ctzsnooze:​ Clicking the little 'i' at top left of the blackbox viewer, shows all your settings. On that quad, both gyro and D lowpass are PT1 (not what you thought it was). I'm suggesting putting the D lowpass to BiQuad and cutting its low pass to 70Hz. You could, as R.A.V. suggests, leave it at 100, but I doubt you'd notice any difference, and lower would be better in your case. Flight performance generally does not deteriorate very much if you filter D more heavily; all that happens is that D sort of disappears from high frequencies. This is good. On the other hand, it's best to try and filter gyro/P the least possible. To get an idea of whether overall noise is a problem, look at the motor traces. Less than 1-2% noise is great, 5% marginal, any more than that is not so good. To find out what your gyro filters are doing, set the spectrum to the P trace. P trace includes the effect of gyro lowpass and both gyro notches. To find out what your D filters are doing, set the spectrum to the D trace. Remember that first the gyro low-pass and the gyro notch filters are applied to the gyro data, then D is calculated (amplifying the fast noise), then the D filters are applied. So if you apply a notch to gyro, you probably won't find anything useful by applying the same filter again to D. To directly compare the overall contribution of P compared to D, leave the spectrum scaling alone and click on P then D then P then D. The relative height of the peaks tells you which of P or D is contributing most tot he noise. I don't change the slider positions from default. Note that the spectrum is calculated, by default, from the entire log. Longer logs will make a 'taller' spectrum than shorter logs because there is more data to build the spectrum from. To directly compare spectrums log to log, always select the same amount of time. To do that, scroll to a start point, press 'i', then scroll to an end point, press 'o'. Now the spectrum is created only from the data in the smaller selection. This allows direct comparison of equal time length bits of different logs. Very short selections can also look at small bits eg just a short full throttle period to analyze that period alone. Also in the graph setup, be sure to set smoothing to zero and expo to 100 on all traces. After that, you can save the graph setup by pressing shift-1. Then pressing 1 will recall it. Same for all the number keys on your keyboard. This is very useful, you can save different setups for roll, pitch and yaw separately, and recall them quickly, with smoothing and expo as you set it. ctzsnooze comments on a log posted:​ PS seems to me like a bit more D on roll might be better. Also the log shows that the motors seem a bit slow to develop the requested amount of thrust. Lighter props might give better handling. mtfinger22: Can you explain what you are looking at in the logs that show that? I'm currently looking at different props for my recent build, and I would like to have an educated guess on what I should do without buying 10 different sets of props and trying them all out. ctzsnooze: The time taken between the RC input signal and the resulting gyro change when doing a fast roll or flip tells you how long it took your motors to turn the quad. In the log posted, the motors go to full 100% signal to turn it at the requested speed, but then it overshoots and the reverse pair have to speed up to slow down the overshoot. And there is a fair amount of delay, overall, between RC input and achieved actual roll. That kind of stuff implies either relatively weak motor power compared to rotational inertia, or over-propped motors for their kv, or battery current limitation, or heavy props, or any combination of those things. Light weight props allow motors to spool up faster and generate thrust more quickly, so the delay becomes less, and the amount of overshoot becomes less as well. Also if you look at the absolute height of your P and D traces (make sure you have no expo on the PID traces in blackbox), you can see that D is relatively small compared to P. That means it is relatively ineffective in controlling your P overshoot. As a very rough 'rule of thumb', a good 'ratio' is D about half the amplitude of P during roll stops. Ensure you don't have expo on the blackbox P and D traces, or comparing heights of P and D is meaningless! You could add more D, which most likely would allow more P, making for a crisper overall response without any more overshoot. Additionally, if your D setpoint weight was set above 1, D will drive the motors harder at the initial part of a stick input, which may help a little in scenarios like this. I have quite a few underpowered quads like this. They need a lot of P and a lot of D to handle as crisp as the more powerful ones, but with tuning they fly great, though they cannot control propwash nearly as well. With a more sensitive throttle they can actually feel much the same in ordinary flight, they just don't go so fast at the top end. These questions are really just basic P and D tuning questions not really betaflight related.

But here's my attempt for a quick and &quot;easy&quot; to understand explanation: Before explaining I will first tell you what determines the Dterm part of PIDsum. It is the derivative or, in other words, rate of change. It is basically the speed of something. Lets say you're driving at a constant speed of 50km/h, then your speed derivative is 0. But when you push the pedal and keep accelerating and start speeding up with 5km/h per second then the derivative of your speed is 5. When you start slowing down, your speed derivative goes negative. Delta from error: This is the classical Derivative approach. It reflects the speed of error. Error is derived from stick input. Once you move the stick you introduce an error and PID controller has to correct the error. The faster the error grows the the bigger derivative gets. It helps PID loop to reach target faster. It is accelerating it more what creates the dampening effect. Delta from measurement/gyro: This is mathematically simplified formula for Derivative from error assuming that error is 0. When you leave out error out of the formula as it is 0 anyway that there is just -(measurement delta) left. And this is the speed of change from gyro. The faster the gyro grows in positive direction the higher Dterm part will be in opposite direction. This has a direct dampening effect to P. The main difference is that Delta from error kind of accelerates your stick input, but also creates derivative kick because it follows the stick which is slower refresh rate and delta from gyro doesn't accelerate your stick input at all and doesn't create derivative kick.  ctzsnooze wrote: Actually, Dterm in gyro mode is inversely proportional to the rate of change of the gyro signal. It always opposes changes to the gyro signal. Frame inertia delays the response of the gyros to P changes, but since Dterm always opposed gyro changes, it typically is opposite in sign to Pterm (definitely opposite in sign to Dterm. When Pterm increases due to positive stick inputs, inertia of the quad initially results in a big Pterm error signal. Initially, the quad isn't moving, due to inertial mass. With no movement, Dterm is zero, while Pterm is quite large. Very quickly the motors spool up and start to rotate the quad, reducing Pterm as the rotation rate reaches target (i.e. as error falls). Dterm slows down the onset of the rotation, smoothing out both the start of the rotation and the end of the roll. But Pterm is always stronger, so the quad eventually gets the desired rotation rate. Because the rate of rotation is now constant, both Pterm and Dterm head to to zero. Momentum may cause the frame to keep rotating a bit past the point at which it was supposed to stop. P weakly opposes this since typically the actual magnitude of the offset due to momentum errors is small, but Dterm is very sensitive to the high velocity of Pterm overshoots and damps them away much more quickly than Pterm can. In the absence of stick movement, Pterm opposes an external force on the frame. The magnitude of the Pterm response is always in proportion to the error between the intended rotation rate and the measured rotation rate (e.g. unwanted rotation from flying into a gust of wind). When there is a positive stick movement, the positive rcCommand will result in a sudden negative error because the frame won't be rotating as fast as the new value for rcCommand requests - at least immediately it won't. That causes a small spike up in Pterm that can be seen with every positive rcCommand step. This is what it means to say that P term is error based . As a result, PTerm changes in the same direction as rcCommand with stick inputs. Once the frame starts to rotate at the desired rotation rate, the Pterm error falls, and reaches zero when it is rotating at the desired speed. When Dterm is gyro based, it is proportional to the rate of change of the gyro signal, and opposite in sign. A non-error based Dterm doesn't care about stick inputs. It just opposes the rate of change of gyro - smoothing out sudden changes in rate, however they arise. While mathematically a derivative, it acts as a damping mechanism for oscillations, like the shock absorber in a car's suspension. While a gyro based Dterm will be delayed a little behind Pterm due to frame inertia, it will typically be of opposite sign to Pterm during stick inputs.  ctzsnooze wrote: Dterm can be calculated on rate of change of gyro signal alone, or the error from rcCommand to gyros. The former approach was first used in Lux, whereas multiwii and Rewrite Dterm were historically error based. Until recently, BetaFlight used error based Dterm calculations, but as of 2.3.4 Boris has gone back to the original Lux approach where Dterm is derived only from rate of change of the gyro signal. Dterm fundamentally opposes changes in gyros, and opposes fast changes more than slow changes. If you hand hold your quad in acro mode and, without stick input, suddenly tilt it a tiny bit, but very, very quickly, the immediate opposition to that sudden small change is coming almost entirely from Dterm. The two methods behave exactly the same in the absence of stick inputs, but differ markedly when a control input results in a sudden 'error' between current roll rate and the new intended roll rate. When D is based on error, a strong 'dterm kick' happens when rcCommand suddenly changes the error value. The kick is usually in phase with the desired outcome, and speeds up the response to stick inputs, because the kick typically overrides the usual Dterm response of opposing movement. However the kick effect causes 'spikes' on the Dterm trace, smaller with Sbus but big on PPM. Dealing with those spikes was the main reason why rcSmoothing was implemented - it removes the spikes, but retains the 'kick' effect. During a sudden stick input, the quad will respond a bit quicker if Dterm is error seeking because D will not oppose the movement resulting from your stick inputs. Whether this is noticeable is unclear, but theoretically it should be a bit more responsive. There is a possible downside, however, in that that wobble after sudden stick inputs (e.g. at the end of a roll) may be less of a problem when Dterm is not error seeking. Additionally if the 'kicks' aren't smoothed they can cause noise in motors during stick inputs, reducing efficiency, and since RC smoothing to smooth them out may cause delays or otherwise be problematic, I think Boris is keen to revisit which approach is best. It might be useful, purely for testing purposes, if we could select the Dterm calculation mode via a switch, so we could change the functionality in flight to really see if it makes much of a difference. Or change it via a CLI parameter. Otherwise its a bit difficult to really know which approach is best, you have to reflash with a custom version and then it's not so easy to compare one to the other. But yeah, with big stick inputs, the new Dterm approach will be smoother on BlackBox during the input, and will always be out of phase with gyros so may delay responsiveness a little to Pterm during stick inputs. It could be that a small increase in P will override the loss of Dterm kick. If so it is tempting to no longer use the error seeking Dterm calculation.

There are several ways to deal with it. Another option would be dropping motor output signals when they come to soon....before the old signal finished. That would be the only other option. Another example: The new way runs cycletime of 125us and PID loop of 375us The motor update happens at begin of the new cycletime and not the begin of new PID looptime! Start GYRO/PID loop------&gt;+125us GYRO/MOTOR-----&gt;+125us GYRO----&gt; +125 PID/GYRO-------&gt;+125 GYRO/MOTOR (375us) Having faster motor rate than loop rate is complete nonsense as the value will still be overwritten and cause jittering. Thats why i am reworking the tasking at the moment. The ideal motor handling would be to only write motors when there are new mixer calculations available and with the time interval between the motor updates never lower than the desired period. Longer motor updates are even not bad just as long as next motor update doesnt fall into previous one. Lets say the pid controller / mixer requests full motor power on oneshot125 which is about 250us PWM interval.....if we were updating motors at 2k interval than there is in total 250us free interval where it doesnt matter when you update it. so allowed jitter period is a bit less than 250us. On 4k speed the motor update period is totally not allowed to jitter to make full throttle possible. It doesnt matter if the motor gets updated too late but should never be updated too soon. With low looptimes like now we are reaching the point where motor updates happen near the end of cycletime. So there is no such thing as delay there. It doesnt matter if you do something at the end or beginning. Imagine like running circles you can't tell what is begin or end. The order doesnt matter anymore. It's near the end of the cycletime where there is the most jitter. The time variations there are between 0 and 100us. Especially on low looptimes with scheduled tasking mechanism to get the maximum efficiency the end of loop cycle is really jittery. So when moving the motor update to the beginning of the loop you always have the constant timing. The variable delay you would have when writing the motors at the end of the loop now becomes a constant delay. Jitter is quite crucial on oneshot signals as period of 60us is almost a half oneshot signal.

Stronger gyro movements, including flips and rolls, propwash shaking, and shaking from bent props, will trigger an increased in the amount of D being applied to the quad. Dmin advance pushes D towards Dmax whenever setpoint changes quickly, and since setpoint changes happen earlier than gyro changes, this leads to an earlier lift in D towards Dmax.

If the quad has warm to hot motors, and you hit things and sometimes need to fly with bent props, or if you are a racer, Dmin at a value lower than 'normal' D is typically very helpful, improving turn-in responsiveness, bent prop tolerance, and reducing motor heat. For freestyle purposes, if the quad is flying well and has cool motors, but has propwash, or some P wobble, setting Dmin to your 'normal' D value and using Dmax as a 'boost' for propwash, by setting Dmax 20-40% higher than Dmin, may help attenuate the propwash. Sometimes quads that have an 'on the edge' tune, with relatively high P, will get noticeable, audible P oscillation during tight power-on turns.

These are good, safe, starting points, for most quads. For high-performance builds, and all new builds, the first flights should be done with the master P and D slider left a few clicks, just in case the PIDs are a bit high. When tuning P and D with Dmin active, be sure to appreciate that the Dmax value is active during the faster periods of flips and rolls, and the Dmin value is active during steady flight and for smaller moves. Some people advocate tuning P and D with Dmin off. The idea is to determine the P value that causes oscillation, and then the amount of D required to control it. The pilot should first set D to about a third of P, push both upwards stepwise until P oscillation occurs, eg during tight fast turns, then back off both P and D until there is only a hint of P oscillation remaining. Then D can be brought up to a value that controls it, which usually would be about a number close to or just below the P value. Freestylers should use this value for Dmin. They may then be able to drive P higher until P oscillations just re-occur, and use Dmax at a higher value to control it. This should give optimal propwash handling as well.

If the Dmin value is set below the optimal D value, to keep motors cool / make the quad more responsive / improve bent prop tolerance, eg for racing, then propwash will likely be worse. During propwash events, D typically climbs only about half-way to the Dmax value. The 'sensitivity' of the Dmin code to propwash is affected by the d_min_boost_gain parameter. Higher gains will push D up more quickly and more aggressively. The default is conservative. It can be set to 30-35 on most reasonable quads, and to 40-45 on really clean freestyle builds. If propwash is the primary problem, and motors are cool, bring the d_max value up, and the d_min_boost_gain up.

Changes in setpoint happen immediately you move the sticks, before the quad starts to move, and before the gyro detects any change at all. The default is 20, which is very little. Zero advance is best for racers, and probably for most quads. Stronger advance (up to 100, say) will push D up very early and that may improve overshoot control on some freestyle setups and in LOS quads that target extremely high maximum roll rates and are very susceptible to overshoot. Because strong advance adds delay, try to use the lowest value possible. Always try it at zero, and if there is no apparent change in the handling of the quad, use zero. With an advance of zero, the D boost won't start until the motors start to turn the quad, which will happen some time after the sticks are moved. This allows FF and P to 'get started' on turning the quad early, and without any suppression by D, maximising initial turn responsiveness. But for very responsive quads, a gyro derived boost signal can come on a bit too late. Adding some advance will bring start boosting D as the sticks are moved, without waiting for the motors to spin.

The default value of 20 is safe for the majority of quads. 30-35 is a good value for a clean freestyle quad. Some extremely noise free quads can be OK with gain at 40-45. Dmin gain at the default of 20 is optimal for racers. It will keep D at the Dmin value most of the time, only coming up for stronger moves to prevent overshoot. It will not help much for propwash like this but gives the racer all the responsiveness and overshoot control benefits. Dmin gain of 35 is good for freestyle generally. Higher values to about 40-45 may be used on very clean quads but are best checked by logging with the debug set to D_MIN to check exactly what is happening. The ideal gain value should result in little or no boost in gentle forward flight but a quick and significant boost effect with propwash. Note that high Dmin gain will make the Dmin boost come on whenever there is fast quad movement or shaking. If set high, a bent prop, or any other shaking process, may cause D to go to the Dmax value, and you may then get a lot of D mediated motor heating. Hence it is really important not to use high gain and high Dmax value unless the build is clean and shake-free. High Dmin gains should only be used for really clean builds that won't be flown with bad props. If the quad can be logged, the ideal gain value for general use is where the realtime D value is at the minimum value in normal flight (not sitting exactly on the min value, but going up a tiny bit at times), and rising to about half way to max in propwash, and to Dmax with flips and rolls. Logging is really helpful to properly optimise the gain value.

If running these earlier versions of firmware try defaults and then adjust 'digital_idle_percent' until the motors ilde at the desired speed. This got fixed in 3.1.2 and up so now digital_idle_percent Only sets the Dshot idle speed. Be aware that Dshot ESCs can run motors at much slower speeds but if idle speed is too low the motor may Stall in flight during hard maneuvers and you get a 'death roll'. If this happens increase the value of digital_idle_percent. Post by Cheredanine on setting up IDLE in ßF 3.1.2 and up:​ Ok first Point - dshot does not use min and max throttle, you don't need to do that. Second point - when not using min and max throttle you should calibrate from bf, not manually set in blheli. Could someone please explain if I need to type the &quot;digital_idle_offset&quot; command? So let's deal with your question. To check what value digital idle should be set to, connect to configurator, go to the motor tab, take your props off. Click the little check box half way down the page that says you have taken your props off, you know what you are doing, you take full responsibility for your actions and you consider fingers pointless appendages anyway. Then plug in the LiPo to the quad (USE a Current Limiter Always). Click on the master slider and use the up arrow on the keyboard to increase the master slider one point at a time until you reach a point where all 4 motors have just started to spin, I don't mean twitch, stutter or start stop, I mean the lowest value where they are spinning, it is probably about 1010, don't worry if it isn't, but I am going to use that number as an example. You can now take the master slider back to zero and unplug the LiPo. Take the number (for example purposes 1010) and add thirty points to it (so in the example we are now at 1040). Not we need work out what percentage of the throttle range this is, I don't know your math skills so sorry if this is a little hand to mouth. Subtract 1000 from it, then divide by 10 So in the example: 1040-1000=40 40/10=4 Go to the cli tab in configurator Click in the box at the bottom and type: set digital_idle_percent = 4 (Replace 4 with whatever digital idle you arrived at in the calculation) Hit return, you will see the command processed in the back bit above, Then click in the box again and type save Hit return and done "},{"title":"ESC Cal and min/max throttle​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Dshot & BetaFlight 3.1","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/DSHOT-ESC-Protocol#esc-cal-and-minmax-throttle","content":"ßF firmware with Dshot does Not use the min_throttle or max_throttle setting, these are ignored.

General instructions for re-mapping pins:​ 1- All FCs that require using the FC's PPM input pin as a motor output therefore can NOT use a PPM RX. Any of the Serial RXs that use a UART do work. Set-up Serial RX normally as needed for the FC board. 2- Check pins for the FC board below on which STM32 pins need to be re-mapped.

KISS24 ESC Beep Codes: 1beep/second = too many dshot errors (more then 10% are bad) but it doesn't disarm it just tells 2beep/second = no valid signal for at last 1/3 second, it disarmed and stopped the motor (ESC failsave) 3beep/second = it couldn't start the motor or the motor stopped because it was blocked NOTE: There Seems to be an Issue with the KISS24 Firmware when running faster Loop Rates. Rossbow reports: We have been doing some testing of the Kiss 24a esc's on BF and it appears the they will not run safely at 4 or 8 khz with Dshot. If you want to test it take the props off and arm the quad in air mode and just let it run at idle on the bench. At 8khz we are seeing between 1 and 6 mins before the esc's start shutting down, it seems they may be getting too many crc errors at 8khz. At 1 and 2 khz we can get 15mins or more, So be warned as you most likely will get dead ducks at 8khz. I have tested 1.08a, 1.08f and 110b RC7 all with the same issue. Oneshot 42 and 125 are fine. BTW its not Betaflight related, it seems the reason the Kiss FC works with the 24a esc's is because it only runs on 1khz with Kiss fw and up to 4 khz on Betaflight. The higher you go in khz the shorter the time before the esc's start to shutdown. So the Kiss FC on BF fw may not show the issue because in the cold weather the flight times are short and at 4khz you may get a full 2 to 2.5min flight with no issue. My advice for using these 24a esc's on BF is either run oneshot42 or run no more than 2khz on Dshot. This is not a guarantee but the best solution until a permanent fix can be found. The Kiss hardware is more than capable of running 8 + khz so I would say its just an esc fw issue. juuuut: No haste I'm on it.

Note: Many of these ESC have an RC filter on the control input signal line. The cap of this RC filter must be removed to use Dshot as per the list below. It is recommended to remove the cap from any ESC even if Dshot seems to work. All other protocols will still work without this filter cap.

So to straighten stuff out: Min and max throttle D shot does not use it. &quot;I changed min throttle&quot; - well that's nice but pointless Calibration​ You don't need to do it, it doesn't make any difference to dshot, claibration is about calibrating PWM pulse length, dshot is a serial protocol, not PWM, don't waste your time And the most important - Caps on or off and the wiki​ Caps on the signal line smooth the signal, removing jitter. Dshot is a rapid change of signal, it looks like jitter, the faster the signal, the more chance the caps will smooth it out, obliterating the signal. Because dshot is 16bits, some signal,values look more like jitter than others. The signal is also effected by other factors than just the caps So removing caps makes dshot more likely to work BUT the records in the wiki are not black and white, they are a record of what people have claimed to work, your quad with the same escs may not react the same. (I have 2 quads with exactly the same escs, one works fine up to dshot300 with caps on, the other needs caps off for dshot at all) What if the ESC I have is not listed or the Picture does not match?​ You are then the Experimental Tester for this ESC. Here is a link to Generic instructions on how to find signal input and cap on any BLHeli ESC:https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36216745&amp;postcount=1645Another Post on finding the signal filter cap:https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36897835&amp;postcount=3488 with caps off Motors are smooth from the motor tab but I get jitter on sticks​ So dshot is fine, when you use your sticks the radio, the reciever, the wiring to the receiver, the gyro, the physical components of the quad and the PID loops are all combining, something somewhere is causing the flight controller to command the shakes you are seeing, fix the problem and stop worrying about dshot Will dshot work with these escs ......​ Dshot will work on blheli_s escs (and of course kiss but there is now a seperate thread for kiss) if the escs are flashed with a version of blheli_s that supports it and the caps don't interfere with the signal. Bb1 processors will not do faster speeds, but bb2 will do up to dshot600. Just because the esc doesn't overtly say it on the literature - dshot came out after many blheli_s escs - or because it is 4 in 1 or 2 in 1 or 0.5 in 1 , well perhaps not the last, but if it is blheli_s bb2 make sure the caps are removed from the signal line and it will run dshot So if you want to run dshot - TAKE THE CAPS OFF (manufacturers are starting to ship with out the caps on) If you don't and you have problems, then guess what?

Method 1. Clippers - used this when there is enough room, just clipped the cap in half the clipped each end off the boardMethod 2. Craft knife - used when other components are too close to use clippers, for example tbs escs - slide the blade so that it is sliding along the surface of the board and in a direction away from other components and apply force, cutting the cap off the escMethod 3. Soldering iron - Heat both ends of the cap with a tinned iron. Then wipe the cap off the pads with the iron's tip.

BF 4.2 Betaflight 4.2 with configurator 10.7 introduces significant and helpful features for tuning, many of which are highly recommended. These features include VBat Sag Compensation, Feed Forward Interpolation, fixed I-Term Relax operation on Setpoint, and looptime improvements that allow for more stable filtering calculations. Existing features can also be leveraged to produce better performing and more robust tunes, including DMin/Boost Gain &amp; Advance, TPA, and Thrust Linearization VBat Sag Compensation is a feature which aims to produce consistent motor response across the entire flyable voltage profile of a battery pack, and does this by slightly reducing peak motor outputs from the mixer at high voltage, and increases these values as battery sag comes into play. This is a highly recommended feature, although if you rely on 'feeling sag' as an indicator to land shortly, or are concerned about damaging batteries, particularly 6-Cell batteries on relatively efficient rigs, you can use values lower than 100 to receive most of the benefits, and also receive a small amount of extra initial 'punch' on fully charged batteries with values such as vbat_sag_comp = 70. Feed Forward (FF) Interpolation has been improved, which uses a trailing average of 2-4 radio control setpoint samples to set feed-forward input values (which are then multiplied by the FF Gains). For noisier or less consistent RC signals (e.g. FrSky R9), using ff_interpolate_sp = 4 is a significant improvement, while more consistent signals (CRSFShot, AFHDS2A-IBUS, Futaba FASSTer) produce smooth enough traces to use ff_interpolate_sp = 2 (default) values with lower automatic RC_Smoothness values (around 8 is still stable enough for long range capable 7&quot; craft). I Term Relax now works correctly on Setpoint mode at values below 20. Particularly for large craft, lower values result in reduction or complete elimination of I-Term driven bounceback on flips and rolls. DMin/Boost tools such as the DMin-Gain and DMin-Advance can be leveraged to increase effective D gains during stick movements (dMin Advance mostly) and propwash (dMin Gain mostly). Values of Gain = 44-55 and Advance values of 80-100 can result in much higher and more consistent D-Term response to damp P-term step responses, while still allowing for lower DMin values during normal flight that does not amplify higher frequency noise. Thrust_Linear is intended to linearize aspects of thrust delivery (which is typically a quadratic response to throttle position) in order to produce more consistent PID response across the range of throttle inputs. In practical implementations, it is most frequently used as a way to increase PID gains at low throttle to compensate for lower authority craft (low voltage 65mm and 3&quot; lightweight quadcopters, as well as 6-8&quot; quadcopters on smaller motors can benefit from values of thrust_linear from 20-30 in order to remove low-RPM bobbles and instability. Quite often, best results are achieved by simultaneously increasing the TPA (Throttle PID Attenuation - most practically this is a throttle-DTerm-attenuation factor at default) value, and moving the breakpoint higher (e.g. TPA = 0.72-0.78, TPA_Breakpoint = 1270-1420). This combined effect allows for boosted PID response at low throttle values, but does not result in excessive motor heat from amplified D gains at high throttle. Preferred tuning methods can lean heavily on the Slider functionality in the 10.7 configurator, with many archetypes of copters being fairly quick to tune quickly with sliders based on quick information, following a standard procedure of determining the correct P:D gain ratio, incrementing the P&amp;D Gains until oscillations or trilling sounds are observed (then reducing 1-2 clicks), then finally adjusting FeedForward through gain sliders and FeedForward Transition (which reduces effective feed forward gain from center point out to the specified value linearly) until desired stick feel is achieved. Note: The D Ratio tuning slider in the 10.7 Configurator is different from previous versions - moving the slider to the right increases D gains while leaving the P gains as-is. Values of 1.2 on the P:D Balance slider produce gains of P≈D, while 1.0 produces a P:D ratio where D gains are roughly 0.8x of P gains. Dynamic Notch Filter ranges are specified by minimum and maximum Hz - if you transport a tune from BF4.1.X to BF4.2, you will need to change the dyn_notch_max_hz value to an actual value in Hertz - recommend setting this value to dyn_notch_max_hz = 350 for most applications.

A value of 0.8 on the PD Balance slider produce gains of P≈D, while 1.0 produces a P:D ratio where D gains are roughly 0.8x of P gains. There are added features, and a couple of noteworthy bugs present in 4.1.X. Setup for enabling bidirectional DShot features (RPM filtering, dynamic idle) is simpler in BF4.1.X, as is configuring RC Smoothing using the configurator parameters. With utilizing RPM Notch filters for attenuation of motor noise bands, changes in lowpass filtering (particularly dynamic lowpass filtering) are typically required in order to achieve the substantial improvements possible with RPM filtering. Feed Forward (FF) Interpolation has been introduced, which uses a trailing average of 2 radio control setpoint samples to set feed-forward input values (which are then multiplied by the FF Gains). For noisier or less consistent RC signals (e.g. FrSky R9), using ff_interpolate_sp = averaged is an improvement, though BF4.2 and later allows for higher numbers of samples to be required (up to 4). The I-Term Relax mode in Setpoint does not achieve any effective values below 20 - for larger craft where lower iTermRelax values are needed or tuning strategies that rely on removing I term involvement to tune P/D Ratios and gain, shift this to Gyro (in 4.2 and later, you can use Setpoint again). VBat PID Compensation is often helpful for tuning flights, and is a recommended setting when conducting blackbox logging, or if craft authority as battery voltage approaches sag points is important. This has been effectively replaced by VBAT Sag compensation in BF4.2 releases. Preferred tuning methods can lean heavily on the Slider functionality in the 10.6 configurator, with many archetypes of copters being fairly quick to tune quickly with sliders based on quick information, following a standard procedure of determining the correct P:D gain ratio, incrementing the P&amp;D Gains until oscillations or trilling sounds are observed (then reducing 1-2 clicks), then finally adjusting FeedForward through gain sliders and FeedForward Transition (which reduces effective feed forward gain from center point out to the specified value linearly) until desired stick feel is achieved. Running higher Yaw P gains is entirely possible, although sliders do not allow this behavior - the defaults in BF4.2 (using the same effective PID gains) allow for running Yaw P Gains equal to Roll P gains, and works very well for most craft, so do not be concerned if during the tuning process higher Yaw P gains are required, you should proceed to increase those gains until matching Roll P gains without concerns.

It is proportional to the instantaneous derivative, or 'rate of change' of stick movement. The faster the sticks are moving, the more FeedForward we get. FeedForward helps P drive the quad into turns. Unlike P, FeedForward cannot cause oscillation, no matter how much FF is added. With FeedForward, we get better stick responsiveness without pushing P so high as to cause wobbles. It also reduces the delay time between input and response. Less delay means less error and less I windup/overshoot. It is great for racing, LOS and radical freestyle flying. It isn't great for cinematic HD. Too much FeedForward can cause: overshoot at the start of a flip, particularly when the sticks hit 100% travelexaggerated responsiveness to RC stepsamplification of shaking when the pilot is cold or nervousspikes in the motor traces and brief shakes with big RC stepsgyro getting ahead of setpoint Since RC data comes into the flight controller in 'packets', we actually get a series of sudden steps coming in. The derivative of an instant step is an infinitely high spike, which is basically useless. Back in 3.4.0 we introduced 'filter' mode RC smoothing, where an 'input' lowpass filter rounded off those steps; the derivative now became a wider spike that we could use. We then applied a 'derivative' lowpass over that spike, which smoothed it out into a kind of 'lump' of FF for each incoming step. AUTO RC filtering adapts the smoothing filters dynamically to the apparent incoming RC step rate; manual setups can be fine-tuned to any desired degree of smoothness, at the cost of input delay. Currently erratic RC steps are a major problem. OpenTx 2.3 improves on this a bit for FrSky users. TBS are introducing a 'locked 150hz mode' that may be better. 4.1 introduces several novel ff_2.0 technologies that improve on these limitations. "},{"title":"ff_boost​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Feed Forward 2.0","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Feed-Forward-2.0#ff_boost","content":"This is a fantastic new feature that markedly reduces delay in fast setpoint changes. Most motors take time to spin up / slow down. They need to be pushed harder at the very start of a move than in the middle. FF and P both ramp up slowly at the start of a move because initially our fingers move slowly and most pilots use Expo in their Rates setup. So until now, the motors haven't got that immediate push needed unless really high FF gains were used (250+). But with FF gains of that magnitude, overshoot is hard to control, especially because of SuperRate being applied at the end of the stick travel, really causing FF to boost the move right when we need the quad to start to slow down to not overshoot. 'ff_boost' is a PID parameter that is proportional to the stick acceleration. Technically it is the second derivative of Setpoint. Being the second derivative, ff_boost peaks really early in a move, the instant the sticks start moving. It then eases away to zero when the sticks are at mid-travel, because at constant stick velocity we have lots of FF, but no acceleration. ff_boost finally goes negative as the sticks slow down. The acceleration component does exactly what we need to help overcome motor delay - pushes early, eases off mid-move, and actively slows down the motors at the end. With the right amount of FF and ff_boost, a responsive quad can have nearly completely lag-free tracking of inputs and not get overshoot. Typically set ff_boost = 15, the default, is about right for most quads. Larger values may be used on low-authority quads or quads with motors that are slow to spool up. More than 40 would be unusual. The strength of the boost is directly linked to the amount of FF set in the PIDs. Think of ff_boost as a 'factor' that modulates the timing of how your FF gets applied to the motors. More boost brings the FF on earlier. Advanced users who can log should do a test flight with fast twitchy inputs, quick left/right stabs, and look for the timing and amount of their FF signal. Ideally P should have little work left to do when the boost/FF components are correct. ff_boost can work without any other of the ff_2.0 features being active. "},{"title":"ff_interpolate_sp​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Feed Forward 2.0","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Feed-Forward-2.0#ff_interpolate_sp","content":"This is a 'digital' way of calculating FF from each new RC 'step'. It gives a cleaner feedforward trace than with the old 'filter' method, with less delay. set ff_interpolate_sp = ON analyses each new incoming RC data packet, and the calculated change in setpoint is converted to an immediate step up in FF. Each step up is held constant until the next RC data step arrives. The sharp corner of the FF step can be smoothed according to the rc_smoothing_derivative lowpass filter frequency. This is set dynamically by default in AUTO mode, but can be manually overriden if desired. 120hz is a good smoothing value for a clean feed-forward trace. 20hz smoothes out traces with a fair bit of up and down; 10hz may be needed for very long range and cinematic quads where the large steps from 50hz mode and poor quality links can make the quad jerky in turns. Dropped RC packets will normally cause sudden FF drops to zero. set ff_interpolate_sp = AVERAGE is intended to help manage this specific issue. Alternatively, a low rc_smoothing_derivative filtering value can smooth the drops out a bit, at the cost of incoming RC delay.

When performing quick flips or rolls, the sticks typically stop suddenly when they hit the physical limit of their travel. With Expo and SuperRate applied to your Rates, the rate of increase in Setpoint is greatest just before the sticks stop. At this point in time, the quad itself is turning really fast and has a ton of rotational momentum. The Expo\\SuperRate effect means FF is absolutely massive too. All this, just before the sticks suddenly come to a grinding halt. Significant overshoot, even with a lot of D, is basically inevitable. In previous versions, you could use D_min to boost your D-gains high enough to compensate, but it was difficult to find the balance. Additionally, the transition would be sudden and the opposing pair of motors have to spin up and go full throttle, which in turn causes wobbles on the other axes and makes the quad climb. Using a ton of D to control this has its own problems, eg noise and dumbing down responsiveness at other times. ff_max_rate_limit predictively identifies situations in which the sticks are likely to hit their limit, and cuts FF in anticipation of that happening. It kind of 'looks ahead' and pre-emptively reduces FF just at the right time, typically totally eliminating the overshoot that would otherwise happen. A major benefit is that it markedly reduces the need for the opposing motors to spin up. Flips become cleaner and more accurate than before, and climb on flipping under LOS conditions is much less. The default value of 100 works well, and attempts to reach FF outputs of 0 as gyro values reach setpoint. Lower values result in feedforward influence tapering to 0 at a percentage of those values (e.g. at a value of 50, in a sustained flip, once gyro reaches half the setpoint value the feedforward term will taper to zero). Higher values allow for feedforward to continue influencing the PID controller. For higher authority craft this will cause overshoot, but for authority-limited craft these higher values can be very beneficial. ff_max_rate_limit is not active as the sticks return to centre. To determine ff_max_rate_limit and ff_boost works best, look at the start of a hard flip in BlackBox Explorer and see if there is any overshoot. If with ff_max_rate_limit = 100 there is still too much overshoot, first evaluate if Feedforward or P-term is driving overshoot at the time of interest. If so, try ff_max_rate_limit = 95. If the overshoot is too well controlled, try 105 to 110. The range of adjustment is quite tight. "},{"title":"ff_interpolate_sp = AVERAGED​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Feed Forward 2.0","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Feed-Forward-2.0#ff_interpolate_sp--averaged","content":"Since FF is calculated for each incoming RC step, we have a problem when a new step doesn't arrive as it should. Usually this is caused by 'dropped packets', or when a TBS or R9 Rx switches out of 150hz mode to the slower 50hz mode. Anytime this happens, FF would normally drop suddenly to zero; when the next valid data value comes in, a double-height step up occurs. These zero/double-height pairs in the FF trace are very messy. In AVERAGED mode, the interpolation algorithm averages each two successive feed forward values. In the case of a sudden drop to zero with a large subsequent step up, this is is changed to a smaller drop, a middle value, and a jump up. Overall the steps are smaller. There is a downside to using AVERAGED. If the pilot makes a fast input, then suddenly holds the sticks perfectly still, ff_spread will hold FF at the previous, high, value for the set time, rather than dropping to zero immediately as it should. This can cause an overshoot for the duration set by the extend value. It is most easily seen at the start of a flip when the sticks hit their physical limit, but can happen at other times. AVERAGED is most useful for long-range / cinematic quads with substantial RC smoothing. For racers and general use the quality of the RC link depends mostly on how good your antennas are and how far you plan to fly. Close-in racing with good antennas, especially with Futaba and some Spectrum radios that have very consistent RC steps, can work best without averaging.

It is important to note that there is a sequence of so-called Euler angles (axes of rotation in space, perpendicular to each other) for board/gyro alignment: yaw-pitch-roll or 3-2-1 Euler angles. The internal rotation convention bf uses to represent the FC orientation is R = Rz(-Yaw) Ry(-Pitch) Rx(-Roll). On one hand the rotation matrix R describes how the FC with respect to the origin of the quad is rotated. On the other hand R describes the transformation of sensor readings of the FC as they were measured with a flight controller aligned with the quads frame (arrow pointing forward / x axis). For the alignment process its easier to think in the inverse transform R^T = Rx^T(-Roll) Ry^T(-Pitch) Rz^T(-Yaw). So we yaw first around the z axis, then pitch the yawed frame around its new y axis and finally roll the yawed and pitched frame around its new x axis. Due to the minus sign positiv angle direction is described by the left hand rule, e.g. to yaw positive you grab the z axis with your left hand and rotate towards the direction of your fingers. You can use the following link to figure out your board alignment angles: https://www.geogebra.org/3d/sj5aeucn For the alignment process think of a frame mounted to your quad and a frame mounted to your FC. The question that then needs to be answered is how to rotate the quads frame (x pointing forward, y left, z upwards) so that the quads frame is aligned to the flight controller frame (x pointing forward on your flight controller (mind the arrow), y to the left, z upwards). Yaw the quad frame around its z axisPitch the already yawed frame around its new y axisRoll the already yawed and pitched frame around its new x axis To test your alignment process before you mount it to your frame use the FC only pointing towards your monitor and the the Setup page of the Betaflight Configurator and simply start with: Yaw the FC, hit Reset Z axis, check the visualisation of the quad, if ok proceedPitch the yawed FC, reset Z axis, check, if ok proceedRoll the yawed and pitched FC, reset Z axis, check, if ok proceedDouble check!

This is built into some Additional GND connection is advised. Assumes that the camera (or FC) has sufficient capacitance at OSD pin (look at Tips for hardware designers section). If you camera is not working, try adding a capacitor between camera OSD and GND. How do I select a suitable PIN?​ A pin with a hardware timer output is required to use the hardware PWM mode. Some FCs have a dedicated CC pin, which is preferable, as it usually already has the resistor in series, otherwise LED strip output or unused motor outputs (M5/M6) are a fairly safe bet. To check if a pin has a timer output, first find out what pin on the microcontroller the FC pin is wired to. This can be done using the resource command, example: # resource resource BEEPER 1 D02 resource MOTOR 1 B04 resource MOTOR 2 B00 resource MOTOR 3 B05 resource MOTOR 4 B01 resource MOTOR 5 D12 resource MOTOR 6 D13 resource MOTOR 7 C08 resource MOTOR 8 C09 ... resource SERIAL_RX 4 A01  In this case, if you for example wanted to use the unused M5 output on a quadcopter, the pin to use is D12. Check if the pin has a timer using the timer command: # timer timer A08 AF1 # pin A08: TIM1 CH1 (AF1) timer B03 AF1 # pin B03: TIM2 CH2 (AF1) timer B00 AF2 # pin B00: TIM3 CH3 (AF2) timer B01 AF2 # pin B01: TIM3 CH4 (AF2) timer B04 AF2 # pin B04: TIM3 CH1 (AF2) timer B05 AF2 # pin B05: TIM3 CH2 (AF2) timer D12 AF2 # pin D12: TIM4 CH1 (AF2) timer D13 AF2 # pin D13: TIM4 CH2 (AF2) timer C08 AF3 # pin C08: TIM8 CH3 (AF3) timer C09 AF3 # pin C09: TIM8 CH4 (AF3)  We have a timer (TIM4) which is not used for anything else (the other pin, D13, is the M6 output, which we're not using). Unmap the motor output pin, map the camera pin: resource MOTOR 5 none resource CAMERA_CONTROL 1 D12  And that's it, your pin should now be configured. In case you want to use a pin that doesn't have a timer set up by default, you can check the available timers by using the timer command again. In this example, let's check if we can remap the rx pin from serial 4, which is on A01 in this example. As it wasn't listed in the list of configured timers, let's see if the pin can function as a timer output using timer a01 list: # timer a01 list # AF1: TIM2 CH2 # AF2: TIM5 CH2  In this case, TIM2 is already in use for pin B03, but TIM5 isn't in use anywhere.

To add your camera control pin to default target resources assignment, use the following preprocessor macro in target.h file: #define CAMERA_CONTROL_PIN pin_name  Use 150-220 Ω resistor inline between designated MCU pin and the solder pad. Consider adding some additional capacitance to support the widest variety of cameras, a 100 nF ceramic SMD capacitor would be sufficient, anything in the range of 100-500 nF will increase user experience greatly. If you're designing a camera, the same advice about capacitance applies. It provides debouncing for the physical joystick and simplifies FC configuration for the end user. Having control over camera firmware, make it less restrictive in terms of key voltage levels with some 5-10% of margin from both sides.

Due to politics others forked the BaseFlight code to CleanFlight. More recently Boris decided that he could possibly make improvements on the way the PID control loop works and forked an Experimental version as BetaFlight.

It has no effect on what is sent to the ESC. The misunderstanding of this comes from the fact that your throttle stick doesn't even begin &quot;working&quot; until you are above min_check. People try explaining this with sentences like &quot;the FC will map min_check to min_throttle&quot;, which while true, makes people believe there is this relation. There is no relation. All that is being said is &quot;the flight controller only cares about the range above min_check up to full throttle, and will remap that range into the 0%-100% input to the flight controller, which then outputs whatever it wants to the motors&quot; From waltr In general (all channels) min_check &amp; max_check are only for Stick commands. then ONLY on throttle channel min_check is used in the code for Arming and PID controller depending on other settings (pid_at_min_throttle, AirMode, etc). mid_rc (Note: this is incorrectly label throttle middle in the CF config GUI) is telling the FC what your Stick Center value is, typically 1500 but may be 1520 on some radios. mid_rc is NOT used on throttle channel. The default max_throttle of 1850 comes from MultiWii and is a SAFE max value for ALL ESCs. Code from MW2.3 config.h file /******************** Motor maxthrottle ***************/ / this is the maximum value for the ESCs at full power, this value can be increased up to 2000 / #define MAXTHROTTLE 1850 DEADBAND is only removing stick center value (all channels except throttle) to eliminate stick center jitter and non-returning to exactly 1500. no more, no less. Do not use this term for anything else. Reading the MutliWii WIKI and even the MultiWii code config.h file will help to understand what these values are. A link is in the ßF Wiki, FAQ: getting started. In CF and ßF the expected stick end point values are set with (I don't know in what versions these came about but were not in the original port of MW to BF code): Code: rxrange rxrange 0 1000 2000 rxrange 1 1000 2000 rxrange 2 1000 2000 rxrange 3 1000 2000 These can be adjusted for radios that can not meet the standard values. These can also be used to Reverse a Stick's direction by swapping the End Point values: Example- rxrange 0 2000 1000 reverses the Roll stick. The FC firmware uses the mid_rc and these to calculate a stick value to hand off to the PIDC code. max_check is NOT used here. If a channel does not get to these end points then the FC will simply not see full movement, either on one side or both. This is one reason I and others and the MW Wiki and CF docs state to adjust the radios stick end points to these defaults. The other is ensuring the stick exceed the min_check, max_check thresholds so stick commands work. Another explanation be joshua bardwell: Max and min channel values are determined by the rxrange command. They default to 1000 and 2000. Max_check and min_check are used to decide if you are entering a stick command. Here is the kicker--how do you disarm the copter if yaw is active? You would have to go full deflection and the copter would yaw like crazy. In order to address this, when the throttle is below min_check, and when stick arming is used (vs. switch arming), the yaw input is disabled. If you are using motor_stop, the motors also stop running when the throttle is below min_check. Sometimes, this behavior is referred to as a deadzone at the bottom of the throttle stick travel. Many people refer to this as Deadband but causes much confusion with stick center DEADBAND CLI settings, therefore DEADZONE is prefered You can see that there is no need for a corresponding disabling of inputs at the top of the throttle range, because you never input any stick commands that require the top of the range when you are flying. The only stick command that is input when you are flying is disarm, and that is low yaw and low throttle. So there is a dead space at the bottom of the throttle range (below min_check) but no dead space at the top of any channel range.

The status light flashes rapidly.Try calibrating the accelerometer.Check RX basics (see below)Reduce the amount of aux channels to reduce time for task RXIf the status light flashes slowly then the CPU could be over-taxed (see below).Gyro didn't CAL upon FC boot-up due to the copter moving. Copter MUST NOT move to cal gyro. An LED (and beeper if connected) will flash three times when Gyro Cals. If it did not cal then do a Gyro CAL stick command or increase the Moron_threshold or enable cal gyro upon Arming (new is 3.0).Copter Tilted more than the 'small_angle' setting. Increase small_angle. To Arm at any angle set this to 180. There is a new task scheduler present in firmware versions greater than 2.2.0 If upgrading from a version prior to this, then check to see if the FC status light is flashing. If it is then this indicates that there is not enough processing time to complete all the features that have been enabled. On newer versions on the ßF Configurator the CPU loading is displayed in the Status bar and MUST be less then 100%, preferably less than 50%. If at 100% then decrease the LOOP Rates (Gyro and/or PID), click Save and Reboot and recheck CPU loading. In the CLI type the tasks command and check the results: # tasks Task list: 0 - SYSTEM, max = 10 us, avg = 0 us, total = 2 ms 1 - GYRO/PID, max = 934 us, avg = 667 us, total = 26004 ms 2 - ACCEL, max = 153 us, avg = 122 us, total = 974 ms 3 - SERIAL, max = 67 us, avg = 2 us, total = 12 ms 4 - BEEPER, max = 8 us, avg = 0 us, total = 3 ms 5 - BATTERY, max = 40173 us, avg = 1 us, total = 47 ms 6 - RX, max = 180 us, avg = 130 us, total = 483 ms 7 - COMPASS, max = 156 us, avg = 125 us, total = 41 ms 8 - BARO, max = 137 us, avg = 106 us, total = 273 ms 10 - ALTITUDE, max = 264 us, avg = 152 us, total = 165 ms 11 - DISPLAY, max = 130302 us, avg = 26263 us, total = 5115 ms  This shows that the copter has Display, Magnetometer, Barometer &amp; Accelerometer systems enabled. Try disabling each one in turn until the CPU loading is under 100%. The list of CLI commands to achieve this are (this can be done in the newer Configurator): feature -DISPLAY set mag_hardware = NONE set baro_hardware = NONE set acc_hardware = NONE  Disabling the Accelerometer will force the copter into Acro mode (no self-leveling in Level and Horizon modes). Important: Remember to save the CLI settings and exit the CLI (otherwise the board will not arm!) One other method to free-up the CPU is to: Move from PID controller LuxFloat to MWREWRITE (Pre-ßF3.0)as the later requires less CPU power.Move from PID controller BetaFlight to Legacy (ßF3.0)as the later requires less CPU power.Disable soft serial. Do not forget to check the Basics. Use the Receiver Tab and check that each stick moves the correct channel slider and the slider moves in the correct direction. If the wrong channel slider moves, then check the channel MAP (eg AETR instead of TAER). Also check that the stick End Point values are still correct. Min/max stick ends points should be 1000/2000. For more information take a look at the Question called &quot;What is the best practice for configuring the Throttle end points&quot;. Make sure your throttle stick's minimum value is lower than min_check! If in the modes tab you see that the quad should be arming but isn't, use &quot;set min_check&quot; and make sure that that is greater than the lowest throttle value in the receiver tab. Is the Accelerometer Calibrated? Needs to be done once to allow arming. To determine if the ACC or other sensor enabled is causing problems use the &quot;status&quot; command in the CLI. The &quot;System load&quot; must be less than 100%.

"},{"title":"What is Air Mode ?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/FAQ#what-is-air-mode-","content":"Some users were mailing Boris about the fact their radios couldn't be configured to have Idle up switch and asking him to implement something similar in the software. Boris initially thought that this could simply just be achieved with activating the &quot;Iterm&quot; from zero throttle together with P and D which were already done with &quot;pid_at_min_throttle&quot; feature. Somehow this wasn't giving the satisfying results. It still felt weak and unresponsive. Boris was trying to wrap his head around why this was the case ! We got our P, I and D on the ground....so why isn't fully stabilizing? After some readings in other open source projects and some of the older discussions, he realized that the key for this was in the mixer logic as someone already had a proof of concept code to improve it, which is pretty much scaling the PID's to our throttle level and stopping the stabilization when one motor reaches min throttle. Now Boris understood why folks always preferred this Idle up switch as it was automatically gaining a little bit more stabilization. But this is just a workaround where you loose some throttle below! The current mixer logic sounds reasonable as the early developers were always considering the low throttle values as a NON flying situation. Guess what? In 2015 we fly a lot with 0 or low throttle and especially in the mini quad scene! This has to be changed! The real answer lies in smarter mixer approach where the calculated PID output would always consider the maximum available motor output range to be able to get the desired correction. With AIR mode the copter will always think it's in the &quot;AIR&quot; and will always try to correct as fast as possible and never become weak. We of course need this stabilization once in AIR! This has it's consequences for our ground situations which you have to be aware of. With Air mode it would mean that the motors could be spooling up after arming, but there is some protection built for that. When you arm and keep throttle stick low (below min check) it will know it is on the ground and the motors will not spool up. Once you move your throttle to higher position for more than 1 second and pitch and roll are not centered anymore it will fully activate the stabilization with 0 throttle! So you have to be aware that if you would land very quickly after first take off that the motors now are able to spool up as the copter thinks its flying and has max ability to correct. Dont worry you can disarm now or you can keep throttle low with roll + pitch stick centered and it will still spool down or at least it will not spool up anymore. "},{"title":"A quicky explanation from ctzsnooze:​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/FAQ#a-quicky-explanation-from-ctzsnooze","content":"Let's say you have PID_at_min_throttle enabled, pull throttle back to zero, so that all motors are at min_throttle, and pull the roll stick to the right quickly. The left two motors will speed up, but the right two can't go any slower. So only the left two, in speeding up, contribute to getting the roll going. Contrast this to a right roll at hover throttle. The PID requested is the same as for the roll above, and the left two motors speed up to the same extent. But the right two can go slower than hover rpm, and they do. That's why, before airmode, even if idle up was enabled, or PID_at_min_throttle enabled, a roll at hover throttle would always be quicker than a roll at zero throttle. What airmode does is to compensate for the motors that can't slow down. With airmode enabled, as soon as the mixer determines that some motors have to go to min_throttle, the other motors are sped up accordingly, so that the differential required to generate the turn is the same as it would be hat hover throttle. Hence airmode maintains roll rate when any of the contributing motors hit zero (or max) throttle. It ensures consistency of roll rate at extreme throttle values. That's how airmode is different from pId-at-min-throttle. The feature might still be optimized based on experiences of the Beta Testers, but is looking good already.

However, once Air Mode is activated, Motor Stop will be overridden, and the motors will spin at min_throttle or above. Air Mode min_throttle value recommendation: &quot;As low as possible min_throttle where motors do not stop spinning at all times is the most recommended one. I do recommend using as high as possible range for throttle like 1000-2000.&quot; - Boris comment **You do want min_throttle as low as possible, but a good rule of thumb is to find the throttle value (in the motors tab) at which all 4 motors spin reliably and without twitches. Then add 10 to that number and set that as min_throttle. For smaller motors (1306 3100kv motors for example), you may need to add 15 or 20 because they have less torque at very low throttle values. As you do a low throttle flip or drop, you DON'T want the air resistance on your props to overcome the power provided at min throttle and cause the motor to bog down and stop. Note: some ESCs can desync on very low min_throttle values when throttle is raised from zero rapidly. If this occurs then increase the min_throttle value another 20-40sec or until the ESCs do not desync on rapid throttle increase from zero. From a Post by teracis: To get airmode working all you need to do is go to the modes tab in configurator and set it to activate the same way you would with an arming switch. This is something you will need to learn so check out a tutorial rather than one of us spelling it out for you here, it will be quicker. I suggest arming on a switch, if you want to stick arm you do so at your own peril. If you want Airmode on permanently, tick the box and then drag the slider so it covers all the way from 1000 to 2000 and it will be on permanently. Using a 3-position switch, the flight procedure could be: Connect Battery and ensure the copter DOES NO MOVE while the FC boots and does a Gyro Cal. The beeper will beep three times once the Gyro is cal'ed.Arm motors (motors start spinning)Enable AirMode (no 'I' windup on ground)Lift off &amp; fly around (motors will never stop in flight even at lowest throttle)Land and disarm motors There are some people saying or complaining about their minimum throttle in airmode. Your min_check determines your lowest possible throttle value out of your TX! The lower your min_check is configured the lower throttle you can get out of your quad in air mode. If your min_check is set to 1100 and your TX goes down to 1000 that would mean that it is already giving some throttle. I use min_check a bit higher than 1000. I believe something like 1015 or 1020 "},{"title":"What is Acro Plus ?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/FAQ#what-is-acro-plus-","content":"Any value of AcroPlus above 0 causes any accumulated iTerm to be reset to zero (and kept at zero) whenever your sticks are at more than 70% of full throw. When restored to less than 70% of full stick travel, iTerm is only allowed to return to 'normal' slowly, actually at 0.1% per processor loop. ITerm therefore takes about 0.5s to return to 'normal' after a flip or roll on 2kHz targets. This improves immediate post-roll/flip stability. AcroPlus changes stick responsiveness by modifying the way in which the PIDs affect the motors, more so at the extreme of stick movement. Individual PID values are calculated as usual, so the PID sum value (the sum of pTerm, dTerm and iTerm) is calculated exactly the same. The maximum possible allowed limit for PID sum is unchanged at 1000. The actual PID sum value can be thought of as the actual final value sent to drive the motors. Acro Plus modifies the PID sum value, essentially in linear proportion to acroPlus/100, and in square proportion to the angle of the sticks, up to the the maximum possible total PID value of 1000. If the AcroPlus value is low, i.e. 1, there is almost no change in PID sum, regardless of stick angle. Basically the PIDs work like normal, its just that the iTerm effects described above are now fully active. As usual, stick sensitivity at 100% stick travel (i.e. maximum roll rate) is set by RC and pitch/roll rates, while center sensitivity is set by these and the amount of applied expo. As AcroPlus values are increased, two things happen. First, the PIDsum values that normally control the motors get progressively reduced in linear proportion to stick angle. Second, and in place of the lost PIDsum values, a simple squared multiple of stick angle goes direct to the motors. Lets consider the numeric outcomes of the current code - I hope I've got this right: If AcroPlus is 100, and you are at 100% stick travel, you PID calculations keep happening but are completely ignored. Output to motors is simply set to the maximum allowed value for PID sum, i.e. 1000. So if you held your stick full right like this, the two left motors would basically go full on and the two right would go to min_throttle. PID loop would not constrain or control this at all. Your quad will rotate as fast as it possibly can. i.e. basically direct motor control around full sticks. If AcroPlus is 100, and you are at 50% sticks, it's a curious combination of the two. The normal PID sum calculation is still active, but the amount driving the motors is halved, while 25% of the maximum allowed output to the motors is added. So if your PID sum calculation at some instant was 350, the amount going to the motors would be 350 + 250 = 600, or 60% of maximum possible. The '250' part is fixed by the stick angle but the PID part will vary according to usual PID processes. If AcroPlus is 100, and you are at 10% sticks, it's again a combination of the two, but at lower stick values the normal PID control mechanisms very much dominate. The drive to motors will be 90% from normal PID calculations, and only 1% of the maximum allowed output to the motors will be added to that (i.e. basically normal PID operation around center sticks). The amount of the 'direct' motor control to stick angle is stick angle % squared. Since 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01, 10% stick angle generates only 1% of the 'direct stick control' proportion available at full stick angle. 20% stick angle generates 4% direct control, 30% -&gt; 9%, 40% -&gt; 16%, 50% -&gt; 25%. Basically exponentially greater proportion of direct vs PID control. When AcroPlus is at a number less than 100, the 'direct control' effects are linearly proportionally reduced, though you always get the full iTerm benefit. For example, if you set AcroPlus to 10, you get 10% of the maximum possible AcroPlus effect. That means, at 100% stick, PID sum will only get a stick angle related contribution of 100, and the rest will be determined as 90% of the normal PID sum value. At 10% stick, the stick angle related contribution to PID sum will be only 1 (1/1000th of the maximum possible) and 99% will come from normal PID processes. Therefore you can see at higher AcroPlus values and higher stick angles, the PIDs themselves become a bit less relevant because the motors are being more directly controlled by the angles of the sticks alone. This makes motor control more direct but also much more extreme. Note that near or very near center sticks, AcroPlus has markedly less effect on normal PID control outputs. Hence, AcroPlus values in the 20's will have relatively little effect on center stick sensitivity, but most likely will significantly increase full stick roll rates over and above your rate settings. Hence Acro Plus can be considered a form of exponential rate multiplier, outside of the normal PID mechanisms, that should, in most quads, increase roll rates at high stick angles quite significantly. The iTerm coding changes prevent iTerm windup problems that would otherwise inevitably cause loss of control or serious bounce-back at the end of such extremely high rate rolls or flips.

So the actual PID gains and rates will vary between them, but the processing of gyro data is identical. The main problem with Luxfloat is that the CleanFlight Configurator GUI by default only gives you 0.1 precision, which is too big of a step for Luxfloat. It would be like trying to tune Rewrite, and only being able to use whole integers like 4.0, 5.0, 6.0. LuxFloat uses Floating Point maths whereas Rewrite uses Integer maths. What does this mean ? Floating Point maths needs more processing power from the Flight Controller, and so F3 (and above) CPU based FCs will have a much easier time calculating the values in the PID loop since it has a dedicated Floating Point Unit (FPU) for these calculations. Why should this matter ? The longer the PID controller takes to process the Gyro/Accelerometer data the slower the &quot;loop time&quot;. Faster loop times are desirable as it makes the copter more responsive to pilot commands, and also (more importantly) the ability to correct to external disturbances to the copter (like wind and propwash). From a development point of view, LuxFloat is easier to understand since ReWrite has to emulate mathematical functions using complicated routines rather than simple commands that a dedicated FPU can handle. People like Rewrite nowadays simply because it is easier to tune because it offers more functional precision in the gains. The days when Luxfloat and Rewrite flew differently (like before Luxfloat had error-seeking D term, or whatever) are gone. Level mode angle control and stick sensitivity is different in Luxfloat from Rewrite in BetaFlight In Luxfloat level/horizon modes, full max angle is reached at full stick. This means very low stick sensitivity in level/horizon modes at rates that are quite snappy in acro, especially if max_angle is set to a low value, like 45 degrees. The stick sensitivity does not change with changing rates. I personally can't fly level/horizon like this. In rewrite, stick sensitivity is managed differently; sensitivity depends on rates and is closer to acro sensitivity. This may result in reaching max angle before the sticks reach their full travel. I personally prefer this (it was my coding hack, I think, that made it like this). It's good both for teaching and for experienced pilots. Boris posted this in the thread about Tuning Rewrite to feel the same as Luxfloat: I was saying that if you would take some time and work out the math that you could produce same numbers with both Just an example to show you. You don't have to understand the code to understand this part. Luxfloat P Code:  // -----calculate P component PTerm = RateError * P * TPA;  rewrite P Code:  // -----calculate P component PTerm = (RateError * P * TPA) / 128;  The difference above is that P gain number on rewrite is higher, but is being divided by 128 in the PTerm calculation, while luxfloat uses directly the number you entered from cli. Note that RateError number is using degrees/sec in luxfloat and in rewrite its abstraction from the original gyro output, but both can produce same PTerm when right P is selected. So if you can find P component what can produce the same PTerm result you will get same behaviour. Practical translation: 1.0 in luxfloat means exactly 4.0 in rewrite just for Pterm. This same translation formula can be done on all numbers like rates, Dterm and Iterm. New in V2.5.4 The 'P' and 'D' Terms in Luxfloat are now shown as 4 times higher to allow better resolution when tuning. The actual PID scaling stays the same and can be seen in the CLI. Additional comment from Boris on MW-rewrite verse Luxfloat: There should not be any difference between both in terms of PID's and rates. Well there is one slight difference actually, which I forgot to mention and even I forgot about it. rewrite still has a bit higher D range. To be exact rewrite has 2x higher delta for Dterm due to averaging summing instead of average dividing the sum. I would rather like to remove this, but dont want to cause people having to retune their rewrite. But even though with this Dterm rewrite should in theory handle bounces better....right? But that isnt the case. I know why. Rewrite has a Dterm deadband integrated in the integer logic, which helps keeping some noise away. But the lower numbers can cause some aliasing in dterm and some lower frequencies which aren't there may be thrown into pid controller. There will be some more data about this soon to confirm, but luxfloat may now become a winner certainly now where it became better tunable. New in ßF 2.8 and above: the PIDC names LUXFLOAT &amp; MWREWRITE are no longer used since Boris has rewritten the code and they not longer use the same algorithm as before. The new names are FLOAT &amp; INTEGER.

People don't realize that there are 2 separate things. There are rates and there are pids. The rates is something we feel even more than PIDs. There is no auto-tuning what can know what rates your brains like. The rates are actually directly being interpreted in our brains to certain stick feel. Good tuning just makes that feel tighter and helps removing unnecessary oscillations. But even with oscillations it doesn't mean that it will feel bad.&quot; - Boris comment &quot;This is the same as my experience. PIDs Parameters are one thing, and Rate Parameters are another. Take a car as an analogy. &quot;PID&quot; would be like tuning the engine, so that fuel, air, timing are correct (things in the Flight Controller). &quot;Rates&quot; are like tuning the steering wheel, pedals, gear (stuff you directly touch like the Transmitter Sticks) so that the 'feel' is correct. And adjustment of the Rates itself made a huge difference on how 'sensitive' the aircraft feels, especially to a noob like me&quot;- Kuson comment d.

Mixer gets PIDsum of all 3 axis and translates that into motor output. There is obviously a certain power available there, which is a range of max_throttle - min_throttle for each motor. Lets say it is typically a range of 1000 (2000-1000). So we have 4 motors determining the behavior of quadcopter with power range of 1000 for all 3 axis mixed up scaled to the throttle. The yaw axis is the one what requires quite a lot of power on quadcopters but also depends of setup used. The ratio of power used for yaw to get the same rotational rate is more than one for pitch and roll. This means that hard yaw corrections could use too much of the entire available throttle range in each motor so the roll and pitch would not have enough of it. But also the way of how yaw works can create a lot of thrust where the quad would gain height to get a desired yaw correction during yaw stops what generate the most power. Therefore the yaw_jump_prevention_limit was introduced to give a maximum of yaw PIDsum with centered sticks. That means that during yaw correction, the yaw is not able to use too much of available motor power so the roll and pitch would not be affected as much and that also the hard yaw stops would not create a lot of jump. Lowering yaw_jump_prevention_limit will result in less motor power spilled for yaw during gate clipping for example as well. You still have the full yaw control when using stick input. But anyway I am still surprised that your gear suffers from jump. I would say that small...and powerfull x quads would typically not suffer from jumps.&quot; - Boris B "},{"title":"How should I configure the FailSafe system ?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/FAQ#how-should-i-configure-the-failsafe-system-","content":"FailSafe is something that needs to be configured in the radio receiver and the Flight Controller.

Joshua B recommends: Calibration procedure I currently recommend for BLHeli 14.5 is min_command=1000, max_throttle=1980, run calibration. Done. Top-end calibration may not be needed since BLHeli 14.5 seems to have much less or almost no dead band at the top. Using max_throttle=1980 is because everybody seems to be getting 2020 as the calibrated value if they use max_throttle=2000. So the goal of using 1980 is to ensure that you calibrate below the top of the scale. Another approach I have seen suggested is to set min_command=1000, max_throttle=2000, and then manually use the Motors tab to determine the spin-up point and max rpm point for each motor, then manually set those values into the ESCs. This is a fine approach too, but a little more intensive. Then compudaze posted: I've had some ESCs still hit 2020 using 1980. Been using 1970 as it doesn't hit the max.

And maintaining multiple versions is really time consuming and not efficient....well actually impossible. Due to a lot of changes in betaflight it is not that easy to just merge things back easily. Betaflight is completaly open source and all code is available for other open source projects like cleanflight. There are actually some developers who are continously working on merging things back and forth, but even those are struggling as divergion is getting bigger and bigger. Also the scope of cleanflight is very wide and betaflight primary only focuses on acro and level performance. Three main open source branches and their focus: Cleanflight (wide focus area)iNav (Autonomous modes like GPS etc)Betaflight (Mainly Acro and level performance) But they all work together and share things.

After increasing throttle a small amount then back to minimum I notice the motors keep increasing in speed. They don't go to max or anything, but they climb noticeably. Now if I was in Angle/Horizon with the accelerometer enabled I could understand that the quad was tying to level itself. But in Acro mode why should the throttle change on its own ? I'm guessing this is an Airmode effect. But just wanted to understand a little more about why. Answer: That is the flight controller trying to correct for changes in aspect, mainly due to fact your quad shakes slightly when the motors spin, the sensors pick it up and then the flight controller tries to correct, it can't because you don't have props on. All perfectly normal. Additional explanation: Originally Posted by MasterZap View Post Sorry, but this sounds like a fundamental misunderstanding of how the I term works. Or conversely, the behavior you see on the bench is exactly expected of the I term. Why? Because the copter isn't moving. If there is no movement, you have no gyro input. With no gyro input, there will be no positive (or negative) error signal to add to the I term. The I term is additive. As error is measured, that error is added to I. If error persists, I grows. If error STOPS, I STAYS. Only at NEGATIVE error does I shrink back down again. Since your copter isn't flying, you are only giving it half of the error (your stick input tells the copter to rotate x degrees a second, the copter is rotating no degrees per second at all, hence you have an x degrees per second &quot;error&quot; measurement) and I will grow. In the air, the copter would start rotating, error would shrink, and eventually become negative and decrease the I term back. So perfectly normal. You simply cannot make judgments on an I terms behavior without letting that I term act the way it wants. With props off, on the bench, you just get meaninglessness. /Z A quick way to test that there isn't some other issue causing it is use the motor test page to remove the PIDs from the equation.

Running Looptime at 250usec (4kHz loop rate) and OneShot125. How to prevent 'no pulses' at max throttle. Since OneShot125 has a maximum pulse width or 250usec this will not work if the looptime is also 250usec. The FC will never set a logic low to have a gap between pulses if max_throttle = 2000usec (OneShot pulse width = throttle output/8). One way to get around this is set the max_throttle to a lower value and Cal the ESCs to this value. Max_throttle = 1850usec should work (one person used this and it works). This allows 150/8 = 18.75usec gap between pulse at max_throttle. This is being called the &quot;Short Cal&quot; of ESCs in the forum threads. So far OneShot42 is not supported in ßF YET but would allow 4kHz refresh rates. Check MultiShot, RaceFlight &amp; BLHeli_S firmware.

If the copter is moving during Gyro Cal then the bad things can happen. Do observe the LEDs for very fast blinking or the three beeps.

I understand that P/R/Y rates are how fast the quadcopter will rotate, and i know about expos too, but what is really RC rate? I can't really gain a full understanding of it. Some say it does the same as P/R/Y, some say it's different from it, some say it's stick sensitivity. But what is stick sensitivity really? Is it like expo? Answer: Think of it as fine tuning for RC Rate. It does the same thing just smaller increments and splits the axis up. Some people leave the RC Rate set to 1.0 and adjust the P/R/Y rates until the quad handles how they like (speed of flips/rolls etc). Once this has been set, the Expo values should be increased to allow for less sensitivity of the sticks nearer their center positions. This will make for smoother flight experience, and have the ability to perform fast rolls etc when the sticks move further away from the center. This is the best way to do it at the moment.

The list of Boards in the FAQ have links to these threads. Any issues/differences in updating are typically listed in the Release Notes which are a MUST READ. Having said all this, one approach worth considering for ensuring your settings are migrated from one Betaflight version to another is described in these videos: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsxTqp76Brshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1sjC5l0ywM In summary, the key takeaways from this video are: Keep a separate custom config file that just has the settings that you have invested time in getting correct for the flying experience you want (PIDs, rates, AUX switch settings etc).Upgrade the FC to the desired Betaflight version then uploaded your custom config file.Ensure the custom config file is up-to-date with PID &amp; Rate values during and after tuning.

There is a problem when you do a big yaw move and then suddenly snap to a stop where the copter has low yaw authority, so the copter cannot respond as quick as it wants to, so error grows large and the P term grows large and the motors surge like crazy at the end of the sharp yaw move. Lowering yaw_jump_prevention_limit will soften the end of sharp yaw moves, but will prevent the motors from surging and the copter from jumping. Raising yaw_jump_prevention_limit will sharpen the end of yaw moves, but will result in the motors surging if you don't have enough yaw authority. If you have a high-performance copter with great yaw authority, and if you want snappier endings to your yaw moves, raise this value as high as 500 (disabled). Remember that this only affects the end of yaw moves, because it only applies when the stick is centered. Addition from Adam Pyschny A to low yaw_jump_prevention_limit can prevent yaw P from getting enough authority to prevent the quad from breaking out in tight, high speed, roll-only turns.

The issue here is that, on extreme acro moves like flips and rolls, the I term can accrue error, and then at the end of the move, the I term trying to unwind that error can result in rebound or overshoot, instead of sharply stopping the move. This parameter causes the I term to zero out when the rotational rate goes over a certain value. The idea is that, in a flip or roll, you don't care about correcting for persistent bias on that axis. You just want to flip or roll close to the targetted angular rate. "},{"title":"How does Super Expo work ?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/FAQ#how-does-super-expo-work-","content":"From BorisB Super expo is similar to acro plus, but acro plus was adding more rotation rate outside the pid controller and the pid controller would fight against that. That didnt really feel natural somehow. Super expo manipulates the pid controller so it does expo for you. It actually works as an acceleration to P based on higher stick input and deacceleration with lower stick input. That also provides more clean acro and less need for D in general. If you have your quad tuned for mid stick you have now....that pretty much stays the same and maybe even a bit softer, but it accelerates towards the full stick. Its like multiwii implementation but with your current rates so you still can have snappy mid stick that what multiwii is lacking a bit. Besides that, betaflight 2.6 allows much higher D without noise so you can get it smooth easier anyway. Another explanation from Joshua Bardwell super_expo_factor works like this. Normally, the way the PID controller works is that the stick position commands a certain angular rate, and then the difference between the actual angular rate and the target angular rate is used to calculate an error value. The P term is proportional to the error value. The larger the P term, the stronger the motors' output to achieve the commanded change in angular rate. Got all that? But with super expo, the way it works is that, the more deflected your stick is, the more the P term is directly proportional to the stick position, instead of the error value. So as you deflect the stick, the PID controller says, &quot;I don't care what the current angular rate is, or what the error is, just push so hard.&quot; Here is an analogy. Normally when you drive a car, you are looking at your target speed. Say it is 55 mph. And if you are going faster than that, you back off the gas pedal, and if you are going slower than that, you push on the gas pedal. That's the way the PID controller works. But super expo is like saying, &quot;I don't care how fast I'm going. Push the throttle to 75% and just keep it there.&quot; As with the I term reset, the idea here is that, when you're commanding extreme maneuvers, you don't care about hitting an EXACT angular rate, like 1234 degrees per second. As long as the copter's behavior is reasonably predictable, you would rather let it &quot;loosen up&quot; a bit and just spin. If you look at Blackbox during a flip or roll, the P term is often switching signs several times. So it is trying to slow down the roll and then speed it up and then slow it down, and that's a bit silly to all be happening in the course of 0.2 seconds while you're flipping around. A Boris comment: Just one additional thing about iterm reset. In super expo mode the iterm is also being reset on roll and pitch above certain deg/sec (default 200) That is really necessary as super expo gives some P acceleration and Iterm would start to windup even more as it would think that Pterm is doing a bad job. The iterm again becomes active below the threshold rate and gets to normal levels in time without you notice anything. Removal of iterm during faster acro manouvres provides more connected feel as all stickyness from Iterm is removed.

F3's with spi gyro (LUX, etc) can run 8K/8K. F4's (revo/etc) on raceflight can run 8K/8K, if using the 6500 or 9250 gyro(sparky2/etc), they are just now starting to run 32K/32K/32K. All these FC can run esc up to 32K esc update rate at no extra penalty. Always check cpu usage via cli command &quot;status&quot;, I prefer to stay under 30% cpu on BF, some get away with more.

There was a discussion before about whether P needs to be readjusted on higher looptimes. Some claimed to feel the difference 1k vs 8k for example and claimed retuning was needed. Were those feeling a placebo? The answer is not conclusive yet, but from my tests there seems to be a difference what can be explained. We already saw improved response between 1k and 8k for example. Exactly the difference you would expect around 800-1000us. Of course PID loop faster means seeing change in rotation faster. How does this translate to different feel or even tune? I was surprised to see that 8k tests showed slightly slower setpoint times vs 1k tests, while the acceleration times were pretty much same. I literally felt more loose quad on 8k. This can be explained by following. Due to faster PID loop the PID controller can see faster that setpoint is being reached and it will start &quot;slowing down&quot; slightly earlier. That's exactly why the setpoint time was faster on 1k. Is this good or bad? Well yes it is an advantage that 8k can start slowing down earlier and therefore you would possibly be able to increase P more with less overshoot like on 1k. Just wanted to point out that some who experienced slightly higher P were not crazy after all . But still these differences were extremely marginal and still nothing compared to different props or motors on same PID loop speed. Next tests would be synced vs unsynced and also 32k as some wanted to know that and also blheli tests. I think from what I have seen i can expect synced winning, but lets wait the results.

Pitching back means that P alone was unable to retain the intended angle in FFF, and iTerm accumulated in an attempt to get there. When dropping throttle, the need for that amount of iTerm changes, and it takes a short time for the iTerm to drop back. In that sense this is a symptom of P not being quite enough, or I being too much. However in some situations ITerm accumulation is inevitable and the challenge is how best to deal with it. In 2.6 code was introduced that set iTerm to zero once gyros indicated a certain level of rotation. ITerm didn't start accumulating again until gyro rate fell back below the threshold. This controlled excessive iTerm gain but caused a small but unwanted step change in pitch at the time of returning back past the threshold. In 2.7 this was changed to not reset to zero but to hold the value iTerm was at when the threshold was crossed. That also caused similar issues on return to normal as it abruptly changed whatever the newly required iTerm value would be. Boris: No in 2.6 and 2.7 there was still iterm reset like in 2.6 actually, but only in super expo mode or when forced in cli. It wasn't in the normal scenario! 2.8 has code that reduces iTerm accumulation the higher the roll rate, but never arbitrarily cuts it to zero. If the threshold is lowered, high roll rate events have less impact on iTerm, but iTerm keeps working normally at low roll rate periods eg in FFF. Could I suggest that people with this issue first try a bit more P, if that's possible, but if more P isn't ideal, maybe try reducing the iTerm ignore threshold to say 50 or maybe even 25. This has the effect of reducing iTerm during high roll events and may improve the situation without reducing iTerm's ability to otherwise keep the quad stable. If dropping the threshold means an overall inadequate I level, try increasing I at the same time. These parameters can be varied quite a lot in attempting to find the best value. But the best solution is to have a quad where P is enough to get the angle you want mostly by itself.

There are no assumptions. Note: Super Expo uses floating point math and when enabled uses much more CPU cycles. This mean on F1 and F3 with IIC gyros targets the looptime might need to be reduced. Boris states: There is more than just super expo. Just lower the looptime on F1 boards. 4k doesn't make it fly better. compudaze's method:​ what I did for 2.8 was adjust rates until my deg/sec at 2000us matched what it was for 2.7 with super expo. Then I adjusted rc rate until my deg/sec at 1750us matched what it was for 2.7 with super expo. It's not that simple though as you'll need to keep playing with the number to get it exact. just keep in mind rates more effects end stick while rc rare more effects center stick. More from Boris:​ Those steps really depend on chosen rc rate. Smaller rc rate = smaller rate steps. Besides that do you really feel difference of 20-50deg/sec that much? Actually everything you ask is in there. Rc rate + rc expo added keeps the top rates, but only changes curve On top of that there are rates what act as super rates where you tune mid stick and than the top rates. I prefer the last one. It is the mid stick what is most important. That is what you tune / configure and use mostly. The top rates are not a &quot;regular&quot; flying scenario. The configurator is the limit at the moment as it is not all clear. Eventually in betaflight configuratoe or next cleanflight configurator each axis will have 3 parameters. Rc rate, super rate and rc expo. That will make all scenarios possible for anyone. Quick summary: Rc rate: linear increase of rates rc expo: add expo curve to existing rate (sexpo) rate: Keep same liniearity on mid stick as it is now, but curve the extremes. Old rates: rc rate and rates = equal....bot liniear. How confusing was that? Another explanation from RC Slater:​ Everyone should set everything that has the word Expo in it to 0. I know by default it is set to .10, but Boris himself has said it's unnecessary, and you should remove it. ONE caveat: if you disable superexpo_rates to get the old linear control back, then you may still want to use some expo parameters to change the curve. Other than that, leave all expos at 0 when using super expo rates. (super expo is active by default) With superexpo_rates, the rotation rate at extreme or full stick deflection is controlled by Pitch rate, roll rate, yaw rate. If you want your max flip/roll rate faster, then adjust those accordingly. If you want to adjust how sensitive your copter feels on small corrections (around mid stick) then just adjust RC Rate. NOTE that Yaw has it's own RC rate because we sometimes want to adjust that mid stick feel on yaw separately from pitch and roll. Example: Stock Rates are : Pitch Roll and Yaw Rates = .7 RC Rate = 1.0 RC Rate Yaw = 1.0 I decide I want to roughly keep maximum rotation rate the same but make mid stick more sensitive on ALL axes (including yaw) Pitch Roll and Yaw Rates = .7 RC Rate = 1.10 RC Yaw Rate = 1.10 Now I like my mid-stick sensitivity on pitch and roll, but want more on yaw. So... Pitch Roll and Yaw Rates = .7 RC Rate = 1.10 RC Rate Yaw = 1.20 Now I just want to increase the maximum pitch and roll rate, but leave Yaw and all my mid-stick feel the same: Pitch Rate = .8 Roll Rate = .8 Yaw Rate = .7 RC Rate = 1.10 RC Rate Yaw = 1.20 RC Slater is online now Send a private message to RC Slater Find More Posts by RC Slater Video from Joshua Bardwell:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cttFDHkec0c "},{"title":"What is the story on the different Rates and Expos ?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/FAQ#what-is-the-story-on-the-different-rates-and-expos-","content":"Thanks to joshuabardwell for this write up. Let's have a little history lesson. There used to be MultiWii. MultiWii had RC rate and Expo. That was it. RC rate set the speed of rotation for stick travel. Expo adjusted the center-stick softeness vs. full-stick speed. MultiWii didn't spin fast enough at full stick deflection for the new breed of crazy LOS Aerobatic pilots (Warthox), so the Pitch/Roll rate was added. In MW2.3 PID controller, the P/R rate relaxed the PIDs as stick deflection increased, allowing the copter to spin much faster. So P/R rates were kind of like a &quot;super expo&quot; on top of the normal RC and Expo functions. The effect of P/R rates was to increase the maximum rotation rate at extreme stick deflection. Fast forward to CleanFlight. Cleanflight had several PID controllers. It had the MW2.3 PID controller, so Cleanflight also had the RC Rate, P/R rate, and Expo functions. But Cleanflight also had Luxfloat and Rewrite, and those PID controllers didn't have the &quot;super expo&quot; like function. They simply used a linear rate curve with expo function, like the original MW PID controller. So what are they supposed to do with the P/R rate parameter in the GUI? Well... they just added it to RC rate, basically. The actual effect was not quite linear, because the scaling factor for P/R rate was not the same as RC rate. So adding, say, 0.5 of P/R rate did not result in the same degrees per second as adding 0.5 of RC rate. But the key thing to know is that, in Luxfloat and Rewrite, the P/R rate parameters had no special &quot;super expo&quot; like effect. They simply linearly increased the rate &quot;curve&quot;, which was actually a line. And then the expo curve was applied on top of that. Now we move to Betaflight. Betaflight continued to play with the PID controllers, as Boris' attention shifted around. For a while, Luxfloat was Boris' favorite, and then Rewrite. Eventually, Boris realized that the &quot;super expo&quot; effect of MW2.3 was actually pretty cool in some circumstances. Possibly this realization was the result of Boris playing with KISS--the timing would be correct for that. That's when Boris implemented &quot;super expo&quot; in Betaflight. At this time, there was some inconsistency in the GUI parameters. If you were using feature super-expo, then the P/R rate parameters worked like in MW2.3, with a big increase in full-stick rate. If you were NOT using feature super-expo, then the P/R parameters worked like in Luxfloat and Rewrite, with a linear increase in rates. And all of this was still interacting with the original Expo function of course. You can see that this arrangement is both confusing and unnecessary. If you want a linear rate function, there is no need to have two parameters (RC and P/R). You can just use RC and Expo and be done. The only reason why both RC and P/R ever affected the linear rate function is because Cleanflight had several PID controllers, and some of them (Luxfloat and Rewrite) had a linear rate function and others (MW2.3) had a super-expo rate function. But in Betaflight 3.0, MW2.3 PID controller is now gone, so there is no need for a duplicate, conflicting definition of the P/R rate function. So the Betaflight 3.0 RC12 rates really represents the ultimate resolution of all this nonsense. There is no more &quot;super expo&quot; function. There is just three parameters. RC rate affects the linear rate multiplier. The rate &quot;curve&quot; is a straight line, and the slope of the line is determined by RC rate. RC rate makes the base line steeper. Expo applies a bicubic (standard expo curve) function to the rate curve. Expo changes the line by making the center-stick less responsive, but leaves the end-points alone. P/R rate (now known as S.Rate) performs the &quot;super expo&quot; function similar to how MW2.3 did it, although a lot has changed under the hood in the way the rates are actually implemented. S.Rates changes the line by leaving the center-stick alone, and makes the end-points steeper. You can achieve more or less the same curve with both expo and s.rates, it just depends whether you would prefer to think about tuning the center-stick first, and then pushing out the full-deflection rates from there, or whether you would prefer to think about tuning the full-deflection rates, and then softening the center-stick from there.

If you see either Yaw Twitches or excessive noise on any axis (A BlackBox Log is a definitive method to see these) then first try proper Soft Mounting of the FC. Soft mounting the FC must be done properly to ensure No vibrations get to the FC board (Gyro) through the mounting. Modern ESCs (active Braking) and modern high power motors can put a lot of noise into the electrical system. Adding a high value (1000uF seems common), low ESR capacitor helps to prevent this noise from getting into the Gyro chip on the FC (also helps with cleaner video and preventing damaging other electronics from high Voltage spikes). There is NO one cure for any copter. Each copter build is different and requires trying the various solutions. Some only need a large cap added, other only soft mounting the FC while some require both. There is a NEW Soft Mounting and Noise Reduction Wiki page. Details on Soft Mounting will be moved to this new page so check back. The following are extracted from posts about this issues with Observations, Theories, Discussions and suggested solutions. Read through all the discussion and follow the links to learn almost all there is about the issue and solutions. First reports of issue:​ Many people have yaw twitches or oscillations at mid-throttle and many do not. All that have this issue seem to be running FCs that use the MPU6500 gyro chip (Naze32 rev6, LUX, others) and newer motors. Boris B was one that did not have this issue with the 6500 gyro until he upgraded to newer, stronger motors. Many have cured this by soft mounting the FC board but this has not worked in all cases. Link to a thread with data on the MPU9250 gyro:http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2718308#post35460394 Much discussion and experimenting is showing that this is an issue with both mechanical and electrical noise getting into the gyro and effecting the Yaw. Following is some of the discussion. Post from Boris​ Anyway something I want to share with you. As you all know I have been flying MPU6500 on several quads without any significant issues for a while. I knew those were a bit more sensitive, but didnt really bother me. I never had any twitches and problems like some had....until this week! So what happened. I was flying with my trusty CM2204 2300kv cobras on pretty much all my setups till recently. Since I swapped to 5S I experienced that those motors were not ideal for that power so I went searching for new alternative motors. That's exactly where the issues started. Once I replaced the motors my 2 MPU6500 quads and even my DOGE fc went completaly nuts. Totally untunable and twitchy as hell. Exact the issues that have been reported in the past. I had to detune my quads to mask the vibrations and twitches. Than I swapped them by cyclone (mpu6000) board and boom.....double as high pids and smooth and locked in as butter. No news. But really funny to experience these issues by myself for once the first time. Originally Posted by Cheredanine​ Interesting it happened on all three FC, Assume you didn't try soft mounting, what motors were you using? Originally Posted by Boris​ 2 of them were soft mounted my DOGE was not. The new cobra motors I was trying out were absolutely smooth on the bench. But somehow at certain RPM the gyro would go nuts. Would love to understand that better. Just random yaw twitches etc like we have seen many times reported on those gyros. After putting cyclone on the exact same quads above with everything else just same absolutely smooth like on the bench. O yeah and cyclone was hardmounted! I actually even tried 2 different motors. Cobra Champion serie 2205 2300kv and Brotherhobby 2205 2300 kv. There is certainly nothing wrong with the motors. There is just some kind of resonant frequency what upsets the MPU6500. And yes I switched back and fourth between my old CM2204's and CM2206 motors, which were smooth at all times. Originally Posted by prokreat​ My money is on the stronger magnets messing with the 6500. Originally Posted by Boris​ It really seems like that! The better the motor quality it seems to affect it more. I really wonder if this is all related to electric noise rather than vibration noise. Perhaps due to smaller factor of mpu6500 it is missing some crucial power filtering circuit. I know invenesense was under pressure few years ago to produce gyros with smaller form factor due to the constant huge demand from mobile phone manufacturers Originally Posted by waltr​ There was a very short discussion about this twitch issue and adding low ESR caps and while ago in this thread. Theory here is that it is the Noise Spikes from the motors/ESCs disturbing the Gyro readings. We know soft mounting can help a lot but what about added caps to the ESC power. Maybe this would be good for you to try Boris now that you have a setup that causes this issue Another may be adding good caps right on the MPU6500 power/ground pins. From what I have seen on the schematics and PCB layout these de-coupling caps do not seem to be properly designed on many FC boards. They don't seem important but actually are very important for modern electronic devices to operate. It could be not a direct issue with the MPU6500 chip but with schematic and PCB layout design not done properly. Originally Posted by joshuabardwell​ I hate to say this because I know vendors with good products who have a 6500 or a 9250, but I personally would not recommend that anyone buy an FC with a 6500 or 9250, because it is just a crap-shoot whether you are going to run into these problems. Many people fly with no problem at all. Many people who have problems are able to soft mount and fix them. But some people have problems and simply cannot fix them, and that just seems like a chance that nobody should have to take, in a world where there are very good FC's using the 6000 or 6050. If there is a &quot;glitchy&quot; FC that you absolutely love, such as the DTFc because of its built in PDB, or the SP3 Evo because of its transponder and built in SD card reader, then buy it with the knowledge that you might be unlucky and have glitching that you can't fix. But if you are just searching around for an FC, and you have no particular love for any board, then absolutely buy one with a 6000 or 6050 chip only. Post from QuadMcFly​ To chime in on the 6500/9250 issue, there appears to be a couple things going on here. As Boris mentioned, there seems to be an electrical noise issue here that compounds things. The MPU 6500 is extremely sensitive to voltage fluctuations on the 3.3v supply line, which raises the noise floor of the IMU. Extra power filtering will definitely help with the problem.

The characteristic of a primary gyro problem is an anomaly in the gyro data exclusively on one axis that cannot be explained by other means. The original descriptions were of abrupt onset jerks, twitches and spikes on yaw only on 6500 gyros. They were so fast in rise and fall that they could not be generated by the motors. Motors and PIDs respond to these spikes symmetrically and normally, clarifying that they were not the cause. Typically the spikes happened only in a very tight throttle range, like within 100 throttle points. There is no doubt this comes from the gyro. While these twitches are much more common on the yaw axis, I have seen logs with solitary gyro twitches purely in the pitch axis, and on one occasion the user changed motors, the pitch axis spiking stopped, but then they went to the roll axis! There is a separate issue with 6000 / 6050 gyros where they get episodes of large amplitude single axis resonant oscillation - pure yaw oscillation, nothing at all on the other axes - at certain throttle points. I had this happen to me with a quad which was flying perfectly for a long time then suddenly it became unflyable due to out of control yaw oscillation. What made me suspect the gyro was that the oscillation was exclusively in the yaw axis, was absolutely huge, at a frequency very different from the underlying noise of the quad, could not have been yaw P feedback since it remained present even if yaw P was set to zero, did not get better despite changing ESCs and motors, was not present on testing in the motors tab, and was fixed by replacing the gyro chip on the board. Until then I would never had believed that a gyro chip could cause oscillation like problems, but now I know for sure that they can, and this has been reported by several people as well as me. Whether something like this can happen on all axes, not just yaw, at certain throttle points, I don't know. So far I guess I've always considered that some noise at mid-throttle on all axes is just the gyro's picking up frame vibrations with associated PID response overlay making them worse than they might otherwise be. I never considered the possibility that intrinsic gyro problems may be exaggerating that mid-throttle shake. I do a lot of hand held testing in the motors tab, and most frames do shake around mid throttle. Mid-throttle frame shake will be picked up in a normal gyro and the PID system will try to fix it. But how do we know if mid-throttle oscillation in black box is just the actual frame shake being detected by the gyro and modulated by the PID loop, or if the gyro itself has some tendency to resonate and oscillate and thereby amplify or exaggerate that stuff? A possible approach is to first find out how much shaking there is inherently in the frame. Using the motors tab and hand holding (with care) you can feel what the props and motors do to the frame at certain throttle points. You then know what you get when the gyro and PID are NOT active. You can then throttle up with the Tx, with gyro and PID active. If it feels the same, your shaking is not made much worse by the gyro or the PIDs. If it seems worse, repeating the test with P and D set to 1 on all axes will remove the PID loop and any gyro input from what the motors will do - sort of like running the motors tab via the radio. One could blackbox the quad with all PIDs set to 1 like that and blackbox will record the gyro output. This will show what the gyro determines the shaking to be PLUS any false data generated by the gyro. The problem is that we have no 'reference' gyro to know actually what is really happening. How do we know if our gyro is being faithful in how it reports the quad to the FC, or if it is exaggerating certain things? We'd need to mount a second 'known good' FC above the 'problem' gyro, and log both at the same time.... So... unless the log is very characteristic of a gyro problem (e.g. twitches or extreme single axis oscillation) it would be exceptionally difficult to be certain what is going on without comparing gyro to a known good one. If replacing the FC or gyro chip fixes it, then that kind of points the finger at the gyro. We are flying these things on the basis that the gyro data presented to the FC is a clean and accurate representation of the true movement of the frame. The possibility that gyros have some tendency to falsely resonate and make false oscillation data at certain throttle points is not a nice thing to contemplate.

Both me and a friend have both had mid throttle oscillations using an Xracer f303 v3. He is using aikon esc, and his was completely unflyable until he soft mounted flight controller. I'm using KISS esc and mine is flyable, but there is noticeable mid level oscillations. full throttle is fine. its just around 1300-1400 get it still even with P's down around 2. both of us are running GTINpower 2205. nice motors but powerrrr hungry Post by Tony Leyland​ On my Alien build I also experience mid-throttle &quot;vibrations&quot; and have tried extensive tuning on BF 2.9.0 and also soft mounting the FC with no luck. I run the following: EMAX 2205 2300KV HQ 5&quot; Tri-blades KISS 24A ESCs V1.1 Dodo V3a FC RC filter to the FC &amp; RX Turnigy Graphene 1300 I see it in the Black Box traces in particular on the Yaw axis. At first I wondered if it was the KISS ESC firmware, but have not flashed them yet - awaiting V1.3 to come out. People are saying this occurs at mid throttle but in my case I believe it to be when the copter's power system is stressed the most. That is when the copter undergoes rapid acceleration and current consumption is at it's highest amount. I can hover at high altitude at mid throttle but don't see the vibrations in the FPV feed or HD footage. I'm going to try the capacitor near the batter lead next and update you guys. Post by fftunes​ Just another small report of electrical noise: Friend built another all new quad with naze r6 which produced a weird high frequency hum, no matter what filters/PID etc were set to. A single cap (35v 470uf) to the pdb fixed it. Post by jubifly​ Had similar problems on my build. I tried both, limiting possible electrical noise with capacitors and mechanical vibrations by softmounting the FC with some rubber o-rings. Both with no luck. I then tried to remove the FC completely from fixed parts at the frame and left it hanging in the air (just the motor and rx wires) and the yaw twitches disappeared. My thoughts on that were that the rubber rings were not applicable (maybe too hard?!) for softmounting... Maybe try leave the FC dangling in the air and see if it still happens - just to definitely eliminate the possibility of mechaninacal noise being the issue. Here is a post from ctzsnooze on a better soft-mounting method.​ http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=35486733&amp;postcount=36111 A nice conclusion on this issue from ctzsnooze​ Lots of us have seen exactly this behaviour. I am surprised that you seem so astonished now that you find it happens to you. It happens randomly. It could happen to anyone. It just happened to happen to you. :-) It goes away with replacing the gyro chip, replacing the FC, or soft mounting the FC; these fixes work whether or not capacitors are added. Sometimes it goes away by just adding capacitors. Since soft mounting is a reliable fix, external vibration seems the likely culprit, difficult otherwise to explain how soft mounting often causes it to just disappear. Blheli-s ESCs are more commonly implicated than non-BLHeli-s ESC's and in some cases capacitors help so there may be an electrical contribution. It is far more common on yaw than the other axes. The yaw sensor within the chip must be physically different from pitch/roll since the axes relative to the layer of silicon for yaw vs pitch/roll are quite different. That's all we know for sure. How these factors actually cause the oscillation, and why it is yaw exclusive, is completely speculative. When soft mounting doesn't work it's usually because it isn't done in such a way as to effectively isolate the FC. I've seen such extreme examples as to render the quad un-flyable, and also much milder examples, so it is not an all or none thing. Although the magnitude is increased by higher yaw P it is not simple feedback oscillation, there is no threshold value of P below which it disappears. The actual oscillation frequencies are so low as to not be attenuated by the o-rings. Exactly what the o-rings block is not clear. It cannot be eliminated by filtering the gyro data - as has been pointed out before, out the primary oscillation frequency is within the range we need for to fly the quad normally. It is not a software issue in blheli or betaflight, we can be sure of that. Replacing the gyro chip doesn't change that software yet it does fix the problem. My gut feeling is that this is an inherent issue in these gyro chip themselves, and that some individual examples of these chips get it much worse than others. That's why I recommend replacing the gyro chip or the whole FC if simple soft mounting fails to solve the problem. another post by ctzsnooze (22 Sept 2016)​ When you guys say you are soft mounting, be aware you need to over drill the holes to 4mm and ideally bevel the top and bottom of the hole so that the FC 'floats' in all axes. You need to check for free movement. If you don't drill out the holes the bolt holes will stick on yaw on the bolts and transmit vibrations directly. Also you can't have anything stiff pushing on the FC, ideally all wires to/from it need to be very fine silicone. You should revisit that mounting and check it does work like you can freely wiggle the board in all three movements. Do that before doing anything else. That is the most likely thing to fix it. I have seen this problem twice (two separate quads, both 6000's, out of maybe 15 machines) and exhaustively tested solutions on those two with the problem. It is pointless trying to filter it out. It is a hardware gyro issue where it is sensitive to noise generated by motors powered by BLHeli-s ESCs. It will be affected by changing yaw P but typically not eliminated. In both cases, proper soft mounting fixed it. Without the soft mounting I also could eliminate it on one by desoldering the gyro chip and replacing it with a brand new one. I didn't try that on the other. My conceptual model is that the hardware PWM system in BLHeli-S ESCs causes some kind of very specific noise at certain throttle points that deeply affects the yaw sensor part of some gyro chips. It is also possible that there is an issue in BLHeli-S code that causes the problem. By that I mean there may be a throttle point where output is not linear. I have noticed that by spooling motors in motors tab very slowly and listening carefully there are some throttle points where the motors lose their smoothness. This non smoothness at certain points is also the case on non BLHeli-s ESCs. It could be that all four motors together at these points somehow encourage positive feedback. To rule this out someone needs to thrust test in such a way to validate linear proportional motor output in the affected range. But to date no-one has done that test or identified any specific ESC firmware issue. FWIW, I disable all dithering in BLHeli-S. Maybe give that a try. But the most important thing is a truly functional soft mounting. Not some half-hearted bunch of o rings​ MotoLab Cyclone boards have plenty of space around the holes, intentionally, no problem there. It's a totally different situation with a Dodo, which has components very close to the holes. Especially tough if the FC bolts need to keep going up for structural reasons like on many small frames, in which case you have no option but to enlarge the holes. I can't stress enough that just over drilling isn't enough. The board can and will slide on the o ring until one hole stops with the edge of that hole wedged on a bolt. Beveling the top and bottom of the hole allows re-centering and is essential with a yaw issue of his kind. I use a cheap conical grinding stone to make the bevel.

I didn't change anything else prior to trying it either. Just in case someone wants to print up some of these standoffs I can put them on Thingiverse or if you want to draw them up they're 6mm outer diameter and 2.9mm inner.

I have the Spracingf3 evo with the 9250 gyro. On a brand new build it was literally unflyable, I don't mean it flew like crap, I mean I couldn't get it off the ground because it was twitching like a stuck pig. Read through the relevant part in the amazing wiki (thanks waltr) tried soft mounting (already had a capacitor on the pdb) and managed to get it in the air, but still had very bad micro oscillations at anything above 1/3 throttle on ALL axis; visible on FPV and blackbox logs. I tried every combination of PIDs, nothing helped. I finally changed the FC to the spracingf3 with the 6050 gyro and all traces of micro oscillations were completely gone. It seems some people have no problems, some people have mild problems, and some like me are left with severe issues. The boards with these gyros are completely hit or miss. I sincerely doubt the quality control (or lack thereof) for this part. More from Boris's thread (7 Oct 2016):​ Posted by mikenxzz: I have a problem with strong magnet motors (Tornado T2 2206), where straight after arming, at idle, the motors vibrate a lot. Reply by ctzsnooze: Yeah I have a build that does this exact same thing with Tornado T2 2206 2600 motors, but not with SunnySky 2204 2300's on the same frame. It only happens briefly while waiting for me to take off, then I never see it in flight. Odd, never seen it before. Haven't blackboxed it yet doesn't trouble me enough. Suspect some BLHeli setting like startup power needs to be changed a fraction. Boris's reply: It happens I have been analyzing several different motor /prop combos and their vibration to determine some better general default filters. I do see a lot of variance in there especially on light and torquee setups. The differences are vibrations over different throttle ranges. For tornado motor default 3.0 causes some low throttle vibrations between 100hz and 230hz. But the most vibration comes around 400hz on upper throttle section. The lowpass filters are not strong enough to completely remove that noise even when cascaded. The only thing what helps is the notch filter on gyro as that one can cut really deep on that specific range. I use double gyro notch with really great results with practically almost no delay penalty. Just some information loss. Notch 1 180hz and cutoff 80hz Notch 2 400hz and cutoff 300hz Dterm notch is default values. That's why I will add second notch option in 3.0.1 patch. But I also have great success with several different de-noising filters i have been experimenting with. Savitzky golay does an excellent job, but its too expensive in terms of cpu. Its the nowadays motors what really cause more microvibrations than the older ones Certain escs will pronounce this noise more. Not sure why blheli_s seems most sensitive of all at the moment. Another solution by Race Miata (posted in the BLHeli_S thread):​ Regarding mid-throttle twitch, I tried all sorts of tuning, filters, FC mounting methods without much luck because of those super torquey 2306 motors. So far what works best for me is to meticulously spin-balance each entire rotor assembly (motor plus prop). I'm talking about less than 0.002g of imbalance with the entire rotor assembly, hard-mount FC (not surprised because just like for onboard vids soft-mounting the cam never works for me to reduce jello but instead hard-mounting the cam works the best once I balance the props, AND sandwich electrical tape between motors and frame to absorb high frequency vibes from the motors after rotor assemblies have been meticulously balanced. The reason for the meticulous balancing is that if motor is not super-hard mounted to the frame then vibes may be amplified. Hard-mount-FC with shock-isolating motors work much more effectively to isolate high frequency vibes from the motors to the FC than soft-mounting FC because high frequency vibes travel thru' hard body (hint: entire frame) very well. By the time it gets to the FC, no amount of soft-mounting the FC can work effectively. There's just not enough mass with the FC for soft-mounting it to work effectively. OTOH, when the vibe-isolating means is further upstream towards the source the whole frame adds to the mass downstream of the vibe-isolating means to effectively absorb the vibes. If you're a race car tuning geek like I do, think sprung weight vs unsprung weight. It's always desirable to have the most of the car's weight as sprung weight as opposed to unsprung weight for the suspension to work best. At this point there's still some mid-throttle twitch as shown in the following vid but with it toned down I don't have to dumb down my PID/filter tuning to compromise responsiveness and prop-wash handling. At least it's much more pleasant to cruise around near mid-throttle now. Before (see my earlier Multistar 250 vids), I hated to use mid-throttle so much I just tried my best to do 0-1 throttle just to avoid using part-throttle. My Multistar250 with Spin-Balancing and Vibration-Absorption Motor Mounts (2 min 40 sec)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXB9Rl7vLDI Comments on this by AILERON8:​ Isolating vibration at its source before it's amplified is standard practice in just about every mechanical and aeronautical engineering handbook that's ever been written. Yet for some reason most folks in this hobby are so laser focused on a software-based filter or FC enhancement of some sort they're blinded to what should be an obvious solution. Dampening the motor vibration, stiffening the frame, or even placing a sensor near or on the motors (utilizing the active feedback signal within the FC software for an automated/enhanced filter) are going to have a much more pronounced effect on noise reduction than all the software filtering in the world. I'd also just like to mention that I am in no way trying to imply that software-based filters in the flight controller are ineffective. Only that reducing motor vibration has great and untapped potential in my opinion Continued Discussion (13 Feb 2017):​ AILERON8:​ The same goes for motor soft mounting, the bolts must be isolated for the method to reach its full potential. I have yet to see a quad with fully soft-mounted motors, but I suspect it would make for the smoothest, most oscillation-free quad ever. So oscillation-free these 32khz gyro's should be all set for takeoff. Floating motors should eliminate the opportunity for resonance to develop and propagate towards the sensitive gyros. Unlike soft-mounting the FC, for motor dampening to be effective it doesn't need to eliminate frame oscillation. The goal for motor dampening is to decouple the frames' natural resonant frequency from the motor as its oscillations vary in frequency and amplitude. All motors oscillate, regardless of balancing. The frame won't oscillate if it's detached from the motors. The motor must completely float in order to achieve this effect however. Which is why I think folks will be in for a surprise when they see how well motor soft mounting can be if fully implemented. I honestly think FC soft mounting will be a thing of the past when the results start pouring-in... Tesseract1984:​ Agreed. Having tried it all (soft mount FC, caps on mains, caps on ESCs, soft mounting motors), this seems to be the ticket. I've had varying levels of success with each option. The most useless of them all being a cap on the mains. Soft-mounting motors makes the most sense. In my opinion doing it to the FC is a band-aid while doing the motors attacks the source and doesn't introduce any delay. A little anecdotal story; i once went overboard with soft mounting a LUX v1 and it actually caused problems. I not only had those rubber bobbins, but also O-rings and the lower standoffs resting on a tpu printed plate with screw holes. What this caused was a very slow wobbling oscillation akin to when I-term is too high (at least in older BetaFlight versions). While multi-rotor flight is still in it's infancy and we are trying new things, yes there are a lot of hype trains. As you can see I've been on them all, but truly, this is the first one that has conclusively solved a plethora of issues including: FPV video interferenceHD cam jelloSporadic yaw twitchUn-tuneable D-termetc etc Would love to see frames come out that have motor soft mounting built into the frame. IMO this should become an industry standard. Also had an idea a few months ago for FC screw holes to have silicon material with a hole big enough for screws. Anyway, just my 2 cents. Just converted my whole fleet using tpu soft mounts and it has literally changed my quadcopter experience. My HD footage actually starting to look like I might know what I'm doing. All aboard, the hype train is leaving the station! AILERON8:​ I agree, too much dampening can make for a sloppy ride. I've over-dampened my FC before using an SPracingF3 board strapped to a giant piece of foam. Sure, no oscillations, but no matter how high I cranked the PIDs it felt loose and sloppy. We want the motors to float, but still let-in those low frequencies untouched. It's definitely a fine balance. One thing I don't believe motor soft mounting will solve though is electrical noise. Most of that is coming from the ESCs via damped light. Although recently Aargh80 came-up with a novel approach to minimize the latter noise using a small 270uF cap in parallel with a tiny MLCC board that can be remotely tucked anywhere in your stack or fuselage. I'd like to see a production version, even though it's not that hard to make it would be nice to have one all set to go for expediency's sake. QuadMcFly:​ Obviously removing the vibrations at the source is much more effective than trying to remove them once they've picked up all kinds of harmonics from the frame I have put together the idea of how to do this, but small volume is too expensive to make it worth it. It involves shoulder bolts 1mm-1.5mm taller than the frame, holes for the screws 1mm-1.5mm wider than the shoulder bolts, and ninja-flex printed grommets to fit the holes. The shoulder bolts tighten against the base of the motor to prevent backing out, but still &quot;float&quot; on the ninja-flex grommets in the arms. there's enough tightness to prevent misalignment of the motors, but enough isolation to be very effective against high frequency vibrations. To make it even cheaper one could simply use the correct diameter heat shrink over the shoulder part of the shoulder bolts and then isolate the motors the old fashioned way. Unfortunately shoulder bolts are super expensive in small quantities. Another post of fixing mid-throttle oscillations by ghall05​ I've had this qav210 for a while now that's had mid throttle oscillations. Changed escs and fc and also tried some different soft mounting methods with no luck. However adding a 25v 1000uf low ESR cap on the main battery connection has solved it! And this is with a hard mounted FC too. Just another data point! I'm putting caps on all my builds from now on. Edit: I should add that I was using a kiss fc first and then a cyclone (which I'm still using now). So mid throttle oscillations can definitely happen on setups without the 6500 gyro. Good before and after BB example of soft mounting:​ https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36091829&amp;postcount=2453 Another Discussion on Oscillation issues:​ vini3019: Just want to share with you guys some of my thinks... Recently I was fighting very hard against mid throttle &quot;side effects&quot; like mid throttle oscillations and yaw twitches (not talking about cases where the issue remains with zero PIDs). I realized that all those issues started when I switched to &quot;over powered &quot; builds where the motors were stronger, props lighter, frames lighter and smaller (with less inertia). I remember that when I was runnig Sunnysky 2204 for example, it was very easy to tune. I was able to push P and D very high without any problems. Yes, those motors are relatively weak with lower torque and slow acceleration. Then I switched to Cobra 2204/2206 and here it started (mid throttle oscillations) but it still was tunable. Today I am running Cobra Champion 2205 2300 and it becomes realy hard to deal with those side effects with just try to tune them out. Trying several ways to solve this issue I realised that there are two most effective ways: Slightly heavier props but still efficient like HQ5x4x4 instead of HQ5x4x3Mechanical damping for FC (soft mounting). And I found it useful not only for sensitive gyros. Assuming usage of low ESR capacitors as a good practics any way. So if I try to analyze all this inputs, I can see that increased mid range torque and higher acceleration speed of the motors combined with the light props, more precise, air mode mid throttle authority and power full ESCs and high discharge batteries can provide destabilization in existing PID controller not only at high throttle but also in mid throttle and fast throttle transitions. Now how heavier props and soft mounting helps to prevent those issues? From my point of view they act as a mechanical damper in close loop system like PID controller. So if our build has good matching between motors benefits and frame inertia/weight, there will be good chance that we will not get side effects. But what happens when we have over powered build where there is not enough &quot;built in&quot; mechanical damping factor? As I can see the existing PID controller not always can deals with it adequately. I think it is possible to add an optional dynamic software damper to the PID controller. We already have one called TPA , but this one acts only at high throttle and it very simple and linear. My suggestion is to think about some configurable, non linear P attenuator for desirable throttle range. The user can be able to define the start and stop throttle points to apply P attenuator and also the attenuation factor. Some similar to how the notch filter works. By this way we will be able to control mid throttle side effects without detuning our quads and possibly deal better with prop wash. That do you think? Boris' Answer: I am not sure what you already tried, but if you use low noise gyro like MPU6000/MPU6050 the noise is really easy to solve. There is really no need of lowering your P's as you suggest just for that. You technically dont even need TPA in that case. The notch default filters in 3.0.1 should deal with low and mid throttle vibrations in most cases. On few of my quads I also have the Cobra champion serie motors like you and had terrible time tuning those without notch filters before.

I used to run a mobile DJ business for 15 years, and I've performed hundreds of gigs in cold climates living and working primarily in coastal Maine. Today it's a balmy 5 deg F for example, but from all those years of experience I can tell you there are three major things that happen to electronics and hardware due to the cold, and they're not good I'm afraid to say. Shrinking &amp; Expanding: Microelectronics are designed to withstand a wide variety of ambient temperatures, particularly the types we're using in our hobby such as FET's, low ESR caps, and large integrated circuit boards. These devices are specifically engineered to dissipate heat, mostly by utilizing the plentiful airflow quadcopters can deliver as a byproduct of their basic functional design. Unlucky for us though, is that the same ability for the circuits to effectively dissipate heat works against us and can overcool certain components on the board. The overcooling will cause the many different types of raw materials the components are fabricated from to shrink at various rates. Although some of this &quot;play&quot; is often accounted for in their construction, when temperatures are severely low the shrinking can be equally severe and cause components to electrically short, crack, become brittle, and break. Damage can vary from temporary to permanent depending on what occurred. Condensation: While in the cold your components will not condensate water, but your goggles will certainly fog-up. If you're running Fatsharks with the little fans then you're pretty much all set, but for those who have no way to get rid of the fog without using your hands, I don't know what to tell you. When you bring your rig back into a warm house quickly after being in sub-freezing temps for an extended period of time, the condensation can be severe enough to permanently destroy things that shouldn't get wet. It doesn't matter how much Corrosion-X your squirt on your ESC's, FC, or PDB, they are going to get sopping wet if you don't gradually raise their temps to room temperature. Trust me on this folks… If you aren't slowly raising your temps then all it takes are a few flights before your quads start shorting, buzzing, and catching fire… Slow Decay due to the Cold: Okay, here comes the main point. If you are flying your quads in the freezing cold on a semi-regular basis you will be shortening the life of every single component considerably. I'm not complaining to you, I'm just delivering the facts. Even if you are gradually raising the temps on your equipment when moving them from the cold, every single component and circuit is being stressed to the max from all the contraction and expansion, and you can't completely stop condensation from building. Here's the nail in the coffin! Sadly, your LiPo is already being strained due to the cold for reasons I won't go into for brevities sake. Your pack really doesn't want to give the extra juice even though it's being forced to do so… It's a bad recipe for sure, and ironically, what happens is you will land with MUCH hotter ESC's, motors, and worst of all, LiPo's. Really watch-out, because your packs can get so hot they catch fire. Magnets… Magnets do like the moderate cold fortunately and actually increase increases in strength by a small amount down to around -125°C.

"},{"title":"Principles and Attributes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Freestyle Tuning Principles","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Freestyle-Tuning-Principles#principles-and-attributes","content":"Freestyle is mainly about the footage of a smooth and precise acrobatic flight. To achieve such goals a freestyle quad should be tuned with the following principles in mind: Optimized for smoothness over low latency and sharp control. Freestyle pilots tend to prefer a smoother and &quot;looser&quot; quad over an extremely reactive (brain reading feeling) one. Mainly because it helps to smooth out micro correction and makes the footage look more organic and fluid. Optimized to behave predictively and with consistency. Consistency helps pilots to build muscle memory and get a feel of the quad, hence gain confidence and precision. One among the best pilots, Mr. Steel is known for running the same setup for several years and he very rarely makes changes to it. With the above principles in mind we can distill three attributes we should optimize for: \tConsistency\tConsistency is the ability of the craft to behave based in a consistent and predictable manner given the provided stick inputs. The more predictable is the quad behaving the more precision and confidence the pilot will gain. Attitude Hold\tAttitude hold is the ability of the craft to keep it’s trajectory and behave as expected. A quadcopter with good attitude resists changes in orientation from outside forces, and responds only to user stick inputs. These outside forces can include wind, propwash, vibrations, and other forces. Attitude provides smoothness. Responsiveness\tResponsiveness is the ability of the craft to track setpoint (stick inputs) as close as possible. A responsive quad has very low latency and feels connected. In theory all three attributes are equally important in practice an increase of responsiveness might affect the pilot ability to fly smoothly and consistently. Therefore it is advised to compromise on responsiveness to keep the quad behaving in a predictive and consistent manner "},{"title":"Betaflight Tune​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Freestyle Tuning Principles","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Freestyle-Tuning-Principles#betaflight-tune","content":"Important note: the suggested tuning values are intended for a typical 5&quot; setup either 6S with [1600 to 1800] KV motors or 4S with [2400-2600] KV motors.

VBatSagCompensation works by adjusting the overall motor outputs depending on battery voltage. Using higher values of VBatSagCompensation, such as 100, will attempt to completely eliminate reduction in power from battery response down to the 3.3V/cell threshold. This will reduce opportunities for a pilot to perceive battery sag .While a very consistent response for the same throttle inputs from the start of a flight towards the end of the flight is great, the inherent risk with this approach is that flight performance will go from nominal to battery dropping below 3.0V/cell very quickly if all the battery capacity is used. For this reason, many pilots would prefer to run lower values if they are accustomed to using the battery sag response to gauge when it is prudent to land. Due to the chemistry of Lithium Polymer batteries, operating them below 3.0V/cell results in plating lithium onto the anode, which permanently reduces both the capacity and to to a peak discharge capability of the battery. This is to be avoided if at all possible.

D is the most important PID term to achieve smooth flying, D helps to minimize propwash as well as dampening any quads movement. Freestyle quads tend to use higher D gains. To counterbalance a higher than usual D gain P needs to be increased as well. A simple approach to tune P and D is to set a desired D gain (e.g. 45) and slowly increase P as high as possible without producing any bounce back on flips and rolls (see UAV Tech video). The I term is generally good enough on default, however if the quad feels sloppy increasing the gain could improve the overall attitude.

This is likely a very minor note, but why increasing Yaw P values can very frequently improve performance, particularly with larger frames or other designs that have more frame mass farther from the CG. Motor max out Another big factor for consistency is that when the craft is commanded to make a move, the motors should not max out.

Showing lat/lon GPS Coordinates on the OSD (and recording the flight with a DVR), logging the telemetry (including GPS coordinates) in the Radio TX or using an autonomous beeper are some measures that should be in place even before testing GPS Rescue.

Basically, ensure your settings will avoid the quad to be free-falling when entering into Stage2.When changing failsafe parameters with Betaflight Configurator 10.4 or lower, the failsafe procedure will be silently reset. Ensure that you set the failsafe procedure manually on CLI after saving modifications on the failsafe tab.Every time the quad is armed, the home point is updated. Prior to BF 4.0, home point was updated on disarm but could be missed if switching rapidly. Best practice for launching in all versions is to arm, wait a few seconds until home point shows up in osd with 0 distance, and then start flying. Otherwise, disarm, wait a few seconds and repeat. Since Betaflight 4.0 you can use this cli command set gps_set_home_point_once = ON in this way only the first arm after the battery is connected will be used as home point.If you're using Crossfire, make sure to configure the Failsafe parameter as &quot;Cut&quot; on your &quot;CROSSFIRE RX&quot; menu.

Do not let it get too close to the ground or to yourself because the landing functionality is not included in current builds. Your quad may just crash near you or overshoot you. You may have noticed that the quad had a hard time keeping a stable altitude. Sometimes this happens when the GPS altitude reading is unstable, so the controller is aiming for a moving target. If you had a very stable altitude reading and the quad still could not stabilize within ten meters of your desired target altitude, you may have to adjust the altitude throttle PID gains. These are the parameters: gps_rescue_throttle_Pgps_rescue_throttle_I gps_rescue_throttle_D We do not expect that most people will have to fine tune the navigation speed gains, but just in case the PID gains are: gps_rescue_velocity_P = 80gps_rescue_velocity_I = 10gps_rescue_velocity_D = 20 After your quad reliably returns home once, you may want to test it at progressively larger distances and directions. When you have a reasonable level of trust in the feature, you may want to set your failsafe to GPS_RESCUE: set failsafe_procedure = GPS-RESCUE With this setting, GPS Rescue will activate in the event of a failsafe. v4.0.x notes - However, it will return control to the user as soon as the radio link comes back. During this time the user should either activate Rescue Mode manually on the radio, just so that there cannot be an unexpected transition to manual control, or be ready to take over control at any moment. Our recommended approach is the first one, which requires having Rescue Mode on a switch if you want to use it for failsafe as well. v4.1 and beyond - After the RC link is restored, Betaflight now requires that any combination of roll/pitch/yaw inputs be moved beyond the failsafe_stick_threshold percentage value before failsafe will be exited and control returned to the pilot. The default for this setting is 30 which means you need to move roll, pitch, or yaw at least 30% off center before it will cancel Failsafe and return control. You may choose to reduce that setting value if you need a less abrupt transition from failsafe to full control. Additionally the failsafe procedure can be activated in the Failsafe tab of the configurator, or by using the OSD menus (FEATURES &gt; FAILSAFE). The OSD menus setting is also convenient to disable GPS Rescue on failsafe in the field if you are flying in restricted or limited airspace (like indoors or among trees).

Check the arrow in the OSD! Sometimes it takes several seconds to point directly to home. Do not immediately yaw heavily or rotate the quad a great deal on arming or immediately after takeoff. Be 100% sure you have a valid Home Point before takeoff. Do a clean, straight, medium speed forward flight directly away from home, soon after takeoff. This helps the IMU correctly determine the heading of the quad from the GPS data, and lets you that the Home Arrow is pointing the right way.Do not enable the Compass unless it has been properly calibrated and the data confirmed, by logging, to be useful and accurate.Use UBlox. GPS units configured to use NMEA often update only once per second, or even slower. This makes GPS Rescue very jerky, and almost unusuable.

This is recommended and is now the default. if the GPS doesn't support UBLOX, try NMEA. Some, but not all, NMEA-only units will provide 10Hz data updates, and can work really well. NMEA at 1Hz makes it very difficult for the quad to fly home; it will jerk and jump every second, with very erratic rescue flight behaviour. test the accuracy of your GPS by watching it in Configurator while stable on a desk outdoors. Zoom in on the map and see how the position moves around, especially if the quad is put on an angle and some satellites are lost. Note that altitude estimation is quite unstable. It can take a long time for the GPS to really settle down. If a Baro is present, enabling it will improve IMU altitude estimations significantly. We recommend enabling Baro by default, especially for short flights (eg up to 10-15min). Usually this results in better altitude control and more reliable landings. Check the baro data in the sensors tab after enabling the ALTITUDE debug. It should be reasonably smooth after arming. Whether or not Baro is helpful is readily seen by doing some LOS rescues at low altitude over flat ground. For longer flights, and some Baro hardware, Baro drift can be more of a problem than GPS drift. Hence do some testing with it on or off and then set your Baro trust value appropriately for the kind of flying you intend to do. If a Compass (mag, or magnetometer) is available, and if it has been properly calibrated, and the data is noise free, it may improve heading estimation. Compasses must be positioned well away from magnetic fields, including those from current flowing through wires. This is very difficult even on a 7&quot; setup. Using an incorrectly calibrated or noisy compass will adversely affect the rescue. Be sure to log your compass data and check that it is accurate and clean before enabling it. In most 5&quot; or smaller drones, Mag is too noisy to be useful.

Basic necessities enable GPS, check its settings, check in Configurator that it shows correct positionset Failsafe Stage 1 to manually enable level mode, and configure a manual throttle value that will make the quad climb steadilyset GPS Rescue as the Failsafe Stage 2 mode, set the GPS hover throttle to a value that hovers or climbs a little, check all the GPS Rescue settingsif you have a Baro, check it using the ALTITUDE debug (see debug info at the end), and enable it provided it works well and improves altitude control 2. Stick-induced Failsafe emulation Here we want the quad to emulate a link loss. As soon as the switch is hit, the quad should enter Stage 1 and then Stage 2 failsafe. To regain control, just undo the Failsafe Switch. DO NOT PANIC AND DISARM BY MISTAKE - just undo the failsafe switch!!! This is great for testing. Basic setup: configure all settings as aboveconfigure a Mode switch to activate Failsafetest carefully 3. Directly enter GPS Rescue with the GPS Rescue Mode swith Here we want the quad to immediately level out, climb and start to fly home - no waiting. It makes sense when used as an emergency 'safety return' switch, perhaps, in cases where you're long-ranging and lose FPV signal, or in Acro and lose control in the distance. Just hit the GPS Rescue Mode switch and it should level out, climb, and head back to home. Undo the switch, and you're immediately back in control. This option does not require Failsafe to be enabled at all.

Then do them with true failsafe, by turning the radio off, and do these tests initially up close! Before doing radio-off tests, ensure that your radio link can re-establish itself if the radio is power-cycled when GPS Rescue is not enabled. Otherwise it can't re-establish when it needs to. Remember to set the GPS Rescue Hover throttle value accurately! The correct value makes the quad hover, or very slowly ascend, while in level mode with the heaviest battery you plan to use. The best value can be estimated by setting Failsafe Stage 1 to Level mode, and then set the throttle value to a value that gets it to climb while in stage 1. The GPS Hover value is the value that the quad will first apply to throttle on signal loss. If too low, it will tend to drop at that point; if too high, it will climb. It is better to 'err on the high side'; climbing too fast is usually less of a problem, than dropping like a stone, when you have signal loss. Remember to set the Stage 1 throttle value manually to a hover value! (See below). When entering a true RF loss failsafe, the quad will use the Stage 1 settings for throttle during the Stage 1 period while hoping to recover signal. If the Stage 1 throttle channel value is set to 'Auto' you will immediately fall from the sky. Set it to a hover value so that it won't do anything bad before starting the rescue. Always ensure that level mode hovers flat and true before taking off. If the quad drifts sideways during return, it's usually because the accelerometer has a roll offset. When adding a GPS module and setting it up, it should always be checked functionally, outdoors, with a laptop and an internet connection. You can visualise X-Y drift on the map in Configurator (zoom in) and altitude drift is shown numerically. Find out how long it takes to acquire the satellites, how many satellites are found at your location, and whether enabling Galileo with set GPS_UBLOX_USE_GALILEO = ON improves the number of satellites found or the quality of the position lock. Check how long it takes for the altitude reading to stabilise after the sat count stabilises. Before takeoff, always ensure the GPS unit returns solid position readings. At least 8 satellites are needed to arm. 10 is preferable, as seen in the OSD. Then wait another 30-60s before arming while watching altitude estimate. It should stabilise before takeoff. Do not rely on the blue light on the OSD. It will flash on a position lock, but that is not the same as having a home lock. Ensure you have a Home Lock before takeoff, and that the Home Arrow points to Home!. After arming, make sure the OSD shows the home icon, distance to home, and the home arrow points to home. Optionally, display the osd_gps_sats_show_hdop value in the OSD; if this gets close to, or below, 1.0, it's a good indicator of a solid fix (thanks @zzyzx). At the start of a mission-critical flight, confirm normal GPS Rescue behaviour a by doing a close-range test rescue with a switch. Once you know that it turns and points to home, revert the test switch. You can enter and leave GPS Rescue with a switch with immediate effect anytime. This makes field checking easy. Think carefully about the GPS_SET_HOME_POINT_ONCE option. Resetting the home point on every new arm is OK for testing and normal use. Each time you arm, your home position is updated. The home position accuracy improves over time, so you're sure to get the best home position estimate when you finally do take off. The downside is that if you disarm during the flight, GPS rescue will take you back to that new arm point, not to home. If your craft disarms in a bad spot, even if you get signal back, it will will never fly home. In contrast, if you choose to only set the home position once, at first arm, it's important to not arm until you are sure you have a solid home position estimate. Be patient when using the first arm only method. The Stage 1 Failsafe configuration is very important, The defaults are not suitable. Choose either: Hold last values: Configure stage 1 to hold all current channel values, including holding throttle, on signal loss. A transient dropout of less than Stage 1 duration will let the craft keep flying straight, or at whatever values it had just before the signal loss. For long-range cruising this keeps the flight smooth during brief dropouts. The pilot must monitor the Rx link in the OSD or they may not realise they getting dropouts. Manually enable Level (Angle) mode, set throttle to climb a bit, and centre the sticks: Probably the safer option. This will provide the cleanest initiation of the Rescue process. NOTE: without a compass, the quad 'learns' the heading of the quad from the direction of travel over ground from data provided by the GPS. The craft must be travelling at least 2m/s, in clean nose-forward flight, for at least several seconds, for its attitude to be correctly set by the GPS data. Try to fly dead-straight and without side-wind, so that no roll correction is needed when the course over ground matches simple pitch-only flight-path of the quad. It's important fly straight and at least 2m/s before testing GPS Rescue at close range, or the IMU may be confused about the direction home. Check the Home Arrow before initiating the rescue. The default GPS_RESCUE_GROUND_SPEED value is 5m/s, and cannot be set under 2.5m/s, so that the quad will update the IMU heading during the rescue, even if the initial heading is incorrect, but may fly quite fast in the wrong direction beforehand. Hence it is really important to validate the Home Arrow early in the flight. The arrow in the OSD should be pointing to home, and the altitude and distance should be about right, soon after takeoff. The GPS Rescue 'mode' switch will immediately initiate GPS Rescue when activated. It doesn't use the failsafe system. This can be used as an 'emergency' rescue for loss of FPV signal or for disorientation when flying LOS. If a failsafe switch is configured, a similar outcome can be achieved by setting the switch mode to immediately action Stage 2. There will be only a short delay before the quad should level out and climb. In both cases, after hitting the switch, the quad's momentum will keep it moving as it was for at least a few seconds, so don't expect miracles. In strong winds the maximum allowed angle of the craft during a rescue, GPS_RESCUE_ANGLE, may need to be increased enough that the quad can make forward speed into a headwind. The the craft may overshoot or land roughly if the wind is very strong, especially a strong tailwind. During a rescue, the built-in Betaflight Crash Detection code is automatically activated (even if you disabled it in your settings). If the quad has a hard crash or impact at any time on the way home, it may disarm immediately. This mechanism is quite different from the much more sensitive landing impact detection, which is only activated late in the Rescue once the altitude of the quad falls below the GPS_RESCUE_LANDING_ALT height.

Yaw tries to keep the nose pointing towards the home point relative to the current estimated position of the craft, using a simple P controller. The maximum rotation rate to control yaw/heading error is 90 deg/s.Throttle is adjusted either side of the set GPS_RESCUE_THROTTLE_HOVER value, within limits set by GPS_RESCUE_THROTTLE_MIN and GPS_RESCUE_THROTTLE_MAX, at all phases of the rescue, to control altitude using PID controller that includes an acceleration element. Throttle is dynamically adjusted according to the angle of the craft (the angle away from horizontal).Pitch angle controls forward velocity, and becomes active, at half max rate, during the ASCEND phase, is fully active once the error angle to home is less than 45 degrees in ROTATE phase, and stays fully active until LANDING phase, when it again is reduced to half rate.Roll is added to yaw only at lower yaw rates, and is essential to deal with heading drift due to wind. It is active only during FLY HOME and DESCEND phases.During DESCEND phase, the craft tries to stay on the edge of a cylinder that is 2m away from the estimated landing point. It will point towards home while attempting to stay 2m out. The 2m distance is intended to minimise the risk of overshooting home, which then requires a 180 degree turn. In windy situations the craft will typically descend on the down-wind side of the 2m cylinder, and may sit on an equilibrium point further than 2m out.During landing mode, the quad can rotate, and will pitch forward and backward to try to land 2m out from the home point. If the GPS has drifted, the final distance to home and direction to home indicate where the GPS thinks 'home' is at the time of landing.Auto-Disarm is triggered by the accelerometer spike associated with touch-down with the ground. The threshold is not user-adjustable. It is only active after the altitude falls below the GPS_RESCUE_LANDING_ALT value in DESCEND mode. If the altitude has drifted high, so that the craft hits the ground but the GPS thinks it is still high in the sky, it will not disarm on impact. If that happens, the landing sanity check should disarm the craft after about 10s (if the pilot has not done so).A DO_NOTHING phase, which is flat Level Mode with throttle 100 steps below the GPS Rescue hover throttle value, with a 20s limit, is applied in switch induced rescues that experience a fatal sanity check error, to give time for the pilot to reverse the switch rather than immediately disarming. Should a pilot notice a failure to follow the above sequence during a stick induced Rescue, they should immediately recover control, by reversing the switch, to avoid the disarm that will otherwise occur.

If too high, the nose of the quad will wander left to right as you return. Default is pretty good.GPS_RESCUE_ROLL_MIX at 100 gives approximately the correct amount of roll to make 'co-ordinated' turns in level mode. A higher value increases the relative amount of roll:yaw and may be needed for higher speed returns. Zero means no roll at all. Use the debug GPS_RESCUE_HEADING to see the amount of yaw and roll applied, while comparing the attitude of the quad to the angle to home.Altitude PIDs (GPS_RESCUE_THROTTLE_P, GPS_RESCUE_THROTTLE_I, and GPS_RESCUE_THROTTLE_D) are best adjusted with a very low set groundspeed (eg 50 cm/s), the quad pointing to home when initiating GPS Return, and a relatively steep climb rate at the start. PIDs too high lead to vertical oscillations after the initial climb. D gives faster oscillations than P. Try to minimise them using classical PID control methods. There is a very big delay from pushing the motors to gaining altitude. The debug DEBUG_GPS_RESCUE_THROTTLE_PID will be most useful. It shows throttle P and D, with the measured altitude vs the altitude target.Velocity PIDs (GPS_RESCUE_VELOCITY_P, GPS_RESCUE_VELOCITY_I, and GPS_RESCUE_VELOCITY_D)are best adjusted after setting the altitude PIDs. They directly control the pitch angle of the quad. Too much P and/or D may cause slow oscillations on pitch. Too much I may cause overshoot. DEBUG_GPS_RESCUE_VELOCITY shows P and D with the speed to home and velocity targets. Tune these with zero I. Then add I until any residual over- or under- shoot is eliminated. Too much I will cause slow ongoing wobble.The defaults should be 'about right' for a typical 5&quot; freestyle quad.The quad targets velocity in the direction of home. If it must fly into wind, the maximum angle (set by GPS_RESCUE_ANGLE), must be sufficient for the quad to overcome the wind. Provided the angle is sufficient, the return home velocity should be reasonably accurately maintained. GPS_RESCUE_VELOCITY_I is important when flying into the wind. On windy days, always confirm that the quad can overcome the wind. A lot of battery power can be consumed flying into the wind, always consider this when thinking about how far you fly out with the wind behind you.

Take care with disarm if the craft is configured to reset the home point after a disarm.To prevent flyaways, the low satellite sanity check will abort the rescue if satellite count falls below half the set GPS Rescue minimum sats for a cumulative increment/decrement period exceeding 10s.At the point of initiation of a rescue, if the basic initial sanity checks fail (eg not enough satellites), there is a 20s 'do nothing but hover' period, before the craft disarms. This applies, for example, in video loss scenarios where the pilot hits the switch and perhaps there were not enough satellites at the time. The craft should level out at the hover throttle value and wait for pilot input or for the sanity check to get corrected.Even if all sanity checks are disabled, there is now an incremental up/down limit of 20s of sanity failure before the quad will be disarmed. In other words, the quad will disarm itself, even if all sanity checks are 'off', in extreme failures of this kind. If you don't like this, speak up. It is a safety feature to prevent otherwise indefinite flyaways that could occur if sanity checks are disabled by the user.

Closer distances may be useful when GPS Rescue is used as a emergency safety switch for LOS beginners.The default minimum initiation distance of 30m and minimum initiation altitude of 5m allow easier setup and testing in a small park.GPS distance from home is measured and logged in cm (not metres) and angle in tenths of a degrees (not degrees) to improve accuracy and smoothness.If the user initiates GPS Rescue on a switch, the Aux channels are still &quot;live&quot;.

They do this for both switch-induced, and real loss, GPS Rescues. They are last ditch responses to a failure of the rescue process. They validate that: the Rescue system has a Home Point to aim atthe craft is outside the minimum distance at the start of the rescuesatellite count is OK at the start of the rescuethe satellite count stays OK during the rescueduring the ASCEND phase, the quad is not stuck in a tree or otherwise can't climbduring the FLY_HOME phase, that velocity to home is at least half the set velocity during the fly home phaseduring the LANDING phase and descent phase, that the descent rate is at least half the set descent rate (not stuck in a tree) When a sanity check fails, it means that the craft cannot complete the rescue successfully. It either has no idea where to go, or is already going in the wrong direction, or is stuck in a tree or something. After some reasonable time, the craft should be disarmed so that it will fall without travelling much further, climbing too high, flattening the battery or burning the motors. Each possible failure has a 'grace period' before the quad will disarm. Sanity checks do not cover every failure possibility. There is no check on absolute altitude during the fly home phase, for example. If sanity checks are too aggressive, they can cause false or premature termination of the rescue, leading to an unnecessary disarm and crash. It is very difficult to find the right balance. Note that 'performance based' sanity checks rely on GPS data. False or erratic data may not only send the craft the wrong way (without us having any way of knowing), it may also falsely trigger a sanity check, or may prevent sanity checks from identifying a true failure. A sanity check failure due to GPS signal loss will inevitably be a disarm the craft, to prevent indefinite flyaways. For switch-induced failsafe, sanity checks have an extra delay period, to allow the pilot time to reverse the switch. There are three sanity check modes: RESCUE_SANITY_ON - this gives the strongest sanity check behaviour, with immediate disarm for hard errors like loss of GPS communication, flyaway, low sat count, and no home point on initiating the rescue. These responses will be the same whether the rescue is 'real' or if it was initiated by a switch.RESCUE_SANITY_FS_ONLY- this is the default mode, giving strong sanity check behaviour for true RC link loss, but additional time to reverse the switch for switch-induced failsafe. For example, the quad will enter &quot;Do Nothing&quot; mode for 20s if a rescue is initiated by switch and there is no Home Point.RESCUE_SANITY_OFF - this is intended for testing only. When in this mode, the quad will immediately disarm only if arming without a Home Fix was permitted, there is no Home Fix, and there is a hard (Rx Link Lost) failsafe. In all other cases a failed sanity check results in &quot;Do Nothing&quot; mode for 20s and then a disarm. For safety reasons - to prevent indefinite flyaways - it does not not turn &quot;all sanity checks off&quot; anymore. For sanity checks with a time element, we use a cumulative up/down counter. Starting from zero, the counter increases by 1 every second the value is 'bad', and decreases by 1 every second it is 'good'. Once the accumulator reaches the sanity check time-out, the sanity check fails. This table explains the currently implemented sanity checks.

Switch initiated GPS rescue may be helpful when FPV video is lost. The quad should quickly climb high enough to get video back. If something prevents the climb, the craft could be flying away in a weird direction, or stuck in a tree, or almost anything. Hence, if the video has not come back within 20-30s, it's best to undo the failsafe switch, disarm, and start searching. This will keep the quad relatively close to the point of video loss, and retain battery capacity by turning the motors off.

But your particular concern was that your motors still felt a bit warm. So I'd map out what dterm cut does while leaving gyro cut where it is. The only way to find out is to do the testing. Once you know the best value for Dterm cut, ie the value where motors are coolest, keep dterm cut and gyro cut in the same proportion from then on. If, despite finding the coolest value for dterm cut, they are still warmer than you'd like, try say reducing both by 20%. If they are cool and you want crisper performance, try increasing both by 20%, and keep going up until they become clearly warmer than with a lower value. If you really want to optimise things you need blackbox. Your motors might just be warm because you fly hard! :-) There may be no PID oscillation at all. If that's the case, and you don't have blackbox, you can keep going up on the filters, both in a fixed proportion, keeping dterm cut above gyro cut to the same percentage - until the motors get obviously hotter or noisier, then back off a step. Then if you could be bothered, repeat the dterm cut optimisation until you have the filters set as best they can be. Note that if you change P or D upwards or change props you may have to modify the settings. On my setups 70 for gyro and 90 for dterm keep motors cool even with the most beat up props, flexy frames and oldest motors. See BB logging page for measuring noise and filter. The sequence in disabling notch filters isn't certain. The best approach is to blackbox the quad with both gyro notch filters off and look at the spectrum of the gyro trace. If there is a big peak there, and that peak is resulting in noise that is visible in the motors trace, then it should be filtered out by a gyro notch. If there is diffusely too much gyro noise, but no specific peak, then either use the biquad fitler or lower the gyro cut low pass filter. Not removing a prominent spike in gyro noise will just not be a good idea. Once the gyro trace is relatively clean, then look at Dterm noise spectrum to decide how much filtering it needs; if it has a spike that is causing problems, it should have a notch. But if you already have controlled the same spike in the gyro trace, you may need no notch on D. If you can control a spike with a notch in either the gyro trace or the D trace, which approach is better? Well, it depends. A big spike in gyro that is not filtered out will cause noise on the P trace that will get into the motors. Notches on D will not get this out of P. The only way is a notch on gyro. On the other hand, if the spike is not very prominent in the gyro spectrum, but Dterm exaggerates it and makes it a problem only in D, then put the notch in D and don't worry about a gyro notch for that particular problem. Without a black box there is no reliable way to know what to do. Certainly you can just disable the notches randomly, listen to the sound of the motors, see that they don't get hot, etc, and keep only the filters that are needed. But as to setting the ideal values, you need to get a black box log for that. Recently helped review a noisy log. Quad had PT1 on both gyro and D, and only one single notch, on Dterm. Log showed no peak in noise at the centre point of the Dterm notch when looking at debug notch or the incoming gyro data! That notch was achieving absolutely nothing! :-) Take home message: you cannot guess where to put notch filters! Notch filters really need a black box log to get them focused exactly on a peak. Otherwise they are useless and counterproductive. If you are going to blindly remove a notch to 'see how it goes', try removing the lowest frequency notch before any others. That's the one that is most likely to mess with frequencies relevant to flight dynamics. A notch filter set very high up (eg 300 centre 200 cut) will have much less effect on flight dynamics than a lower notch filter (eg 200 centre 140 cut). Did a heap of testing today... interesting stuff. I realized that if you put P, I and D all to 2 (ie, almost totally off), what you the blackbox the gyro trace (quad safely hand held or in a restraint) shows gyro data without amplification by PIDs. If you zoom in on gyro (say 1000 times, with no expo on the trace), you can see the 'input' noise as would go into the PID loop. If we then add P alone, and test while (safely) hand held, it becomes apparent that the amount of noise added by the 'P' part of the PID calculations is small. Even with PT1 and no notch filters, P itself doesn't seem to be much affected by motor noise, nor contribute to feedback resonance in a big way. If it wasn't for D, all we'd need is a PT1 on gyro. But when you add D - that's when it gets interesting. With only a PT1 on gyro, D carries a heap of amplified noise back to the motors - even if D lowpass is a biquad. This is a cunning way to identify what P or D individually add to the noise sent back to the motors. Overall I get the impression that we need more D filtering than Gyro filtering. We can drop back on gyro, but when we do, more noise gets through to D, making a worse overall noise picture. A but more D filtering would allow less gyro filtering, and probably better handling. PS - I too had many occurrences of 'prop resonance' where the frame shakes and the prop blades flex like crazy, starting really abruptly at just above idle throttle, and easing off with more throttle. It starts abruptly, sounds really bad, the quad shakes violently, and if you're on the ground it adds thrust and tries to fly away. If you throttle past it, all comes good again. Motors quickly get hot! I recorded it. In my case it was a very narrow peak at exactly 145 Hz, put a single gyro notch filter there and it disappeared. Interestingly this shaking was entirely in pitch and roll, yaw was flat and smooth. Also the D component was three times larger than the P component. Once a carefully placed notch filter eliminated the problem, flight was entirely normal all the time. I don't really understand what's causing this, it is definitely a feedback process driven mostly by D, but why it should be so powerful at such low rpm has me beat.

Setpoint transition has been disabled (1.0) to give more linearity over the entire stick. I still recommend that you slowly remove default filtering as well if your setup allows you for best results. Nowadays most do softmounting so removing of filters can easily improve performance. The defaults are optimized for hard mounted medium noisy environment for safety. The best tuning performance is achieved with as less Du. I think best filter removal steps would be.​ set d_lowpass_type = PT1 (in the CLI) should always be done first and I think possible on every setup. If it is still fine than: Remove notch 1 (set Gyro Notch Filter 1 Frequency[Hz] = 0 in the config GUI or in CLI type &quot;set gyro_notch1_hz = 0&quot; to disable Notch filter) Then if its still fine Remove notch 2 (set Gyro Notch Filter 2 Frequency[Hz] = 0 in the config GUI or in CLI type &quot;set gyro_notch2_hz = 0&quot; to disable Notch filter) Now if your setup is still clean you could even remove the dterm notch (set D Term Notch Filter Frequency[Hz] = 0 in the config GUI or in CLI type &quot;set d_notch_hz = 0&quot; to disable Notch filter). That will give you the best results. Sharpest response, easiest tuning and literally no prop wash on good setups. Note that default betaflight filters are made so every beginner can put a quad in air without burning his gear. Dterm lowpass is always needed. Never remove that! Even on the cleanest setup. I think if you really put some effort to build a clean setup you easily can get away without most of other filter settings. To test that I was able to repeat it on 3 of my builds. Hardware softmounting is always filtering without extra penalty. The most difference with and with filtering comes from the steep gyro changes. The more filtering there is the slower P will react on high gyro changes and translates itself to more prop wash and less direct feel. As I said defaults are meant to be safe and protect against most common vibrations shown across many hardmounted 4 / 5inch setups. But more and more people care about clean setup nowadays than lets say 1 year ago and that means you may get much better running setup with some filter removals. question from linklemming:​ From BB analysis with debug notch on, I have determined that D lowpass of PT1 is fine and that I only really 1 notch filter (300Hz Center, 200Hz low). I have a softmounted FC. I can see the spike in the frequency range both in P and D. Boris mentions removing gyro notches first, I'm wondering what the trade-offs would be in selecting gyro notch vs D notch. Obviously if using only gyro notch, I get noise reductions in P and D and it seems to me this is better than using D notch unless there is some flight behaviors that would be better suited to using D notch only. The noise I believe is low enough that any P noise from using just D notch would be minimal. Interestingly all the quads I did testing on this weekend show the same noise spike around 300Hz (+/- 30Hz). This includes: F1-4B 3mm with DYS 1806-2700kv motors, dal 4045V2 tri blades on 4s My own design sub250g 180 quad(3mm) with rcx1306-3100kv, dal 4045 dual blades on 4s My own design sub250g 150 quad(3mm) with dys1306-4000kv, dal 4045 dual blades cut to 3&quot; on 4s Im guessing this is just frame resonance? All are 3mm single baseplate designs. Answer from ctzsnooze: To be honest, no-one really knows. If you compare D trace (zoom in, smoothing off, expo off) to P trace (same zoom), and if most of the noise is in D, then there are two ways of dealing with it. First way of thinking about it, just filter what is bad - ie just filter D only. This fixes the noise problem and delays P the least. Second, put the notch on gyro, that's where the noise is coming, this way both P and D will have less noise, and the relative phase lag between P and D won't change. Frankly I doubt it makes any difference.. I do like the idea of only adding filtering where it is necessary; in this case, just putting the notch on D. Sure there will be slightly more phase delay between P and D, but D is already phase delayed because of the D lowpass filter, and the extra phase delay from a 300/200 notch filter on D alone may have no adverse effect. If you had time to try both and compare logs, that would be great. If possible make your flight testing 'blind', ie get someone else to make the change in the firmware so you don't know which you are flying. Be surprised if it makes the slightest difference. If you had to enable the notch filter lower down, eg centre 145 cut 90, for example, it might matter a lot. But high up probably either way is fine, gyro should end up slightly smoother and fly just as well. Testimonials​ Redtail2426: So I ended up switching to pt1, removing both notch filters, and removed the d term notch filter, and the prop wash is pretty much 99% gone, much much better than it was with the default 3.1.7 filtering. Awesome job guys kevinpratt823: I got rid of the Dterm notch and went PT1 yesterday as well, and it was a considerable improvement on a high power to weight build that was struggling with that last bit of oscillation, opened my tuning window up, raised PIDs a bit. Hattrickmwf: Going to PT1 and removing all the notch filters made a huge difference in my quad too. Almost Zero prop wash. I also noticed it handles impacts with gates or ground touches much better too. No Tasmanian Devil quad after impact. May be placebo effect, but it seems to handle a lot better too. Cheredanine: Some interesting stuff: I removed filters on f3 flight controller, by the time I removed first notch filter flight performance was much improved (perceptively) when I removed second notch didn't make much difference (or none that I noticed subjectively) although bb gyro traces remained clean, clearly there was a sort of milestone I passed in terms of latency. I repeated on an almost identical quad running f4, this is where it got interesting, the improvement was similar but les marked, subjectively the most noticeable thing was prop wash vanished. BUT, On a whim I switched from 8khz/4khz to 32khz/16khz the change in speed had a dramatic effect, gyro traces were noisy as hell, but motor noise was at values like 400kz which 8khz should find easily. Front two motors got warm and audibly screamed over about 15-20% throttle. Quad actually flew quite well. Got both set of bb logs and not particularly worried as I usually fly8/4 but thought the result was quite interesting. Oz asked: You find 8/4 flies better than 32/16? (Properly soft mounted) Cheredanine's answer: Subjective but I don't find improvement over 8/4, probably less than that. I have 5 quads with bluejay f4s in them, i gave 32/16 a good test since it became available. Provided you tune it properly, 8/4 is as good as 32/16 as far as I can tell, I am 100% sure I would not be able to tell the difference in a blind test. (The quads I mentioned above are both dquad obsessions with returner r4, 25a blheli_s 16.6 escs, one uses an rg-ssd, the other has a bluejay., no noticeable difference in flight apart from: Normally (with filters) 32/16khz has motor noise above 4khz, this is not apparent on spectrographs at 8/4 but then given the scale of the graph and Nyquist limit I wouldn't expect it to. But strip back the filtering and 32/16 is far messier, flies ok, but the heat and noise from the motor was worrying. All quads have vibration isolation on the fc, where possible using rubber standoffs (exceptions being shrike and tokio-x prototype, the former has to use rubber o rings and the latter has a unique vibrations isolation mount). 32/16 has so far not flown any better than 8/4 and in some cases flown considerably worse. Boris provided the following info: There is additional filtering present when running at 8khz gyro or lower, this is not present when running 32khz. Therefore changing d low-pass to pt1 and removing notch filters when running 32khz will produce much messier gyros. In summary I found quad flew fantastic on 8khz gyro with filters stripped back but on 32khz gryo I had to leave them in place to get similar performance and no heat in motors. Posted by QuadMcFly: So here's my experience with PT1 and the notch filters, as well as some other general thoughts. I gave RF1 a shot for about a month, because I like to try things so I can actually speak from experience. Something about my rig really hated RF1. I had some pretty significant issues with low throttle noise, and the stick handling never felt right. Kind of felt unpredictable like I was having to fight it instead of flowing with it. I don't necessarily think that is reflective of everyone's experience on RF1, I just think there are some setups that it doesn't like at all, and mine happened to be one of them. Anyway I got tired of fighting it, so I put BF 3.1.7 on the revolt, 8k/8k PT1 Dterm, lower gyro notch removed. Got it flying a few days ago and I have been totally blown away. The difference was stunning. Like going from PPM to S.Bus all over again. I don't think I've ever flown anything that flew this well, and I've flown a lot of stuff! It still needs a bit of adjustment to clean up that last bit of prop wash, but man alive! Amazing for a totally blind tune, just thrown in based on the power train. The stick feel is utterly amazing in terms of precision and crispness. As I mentioned a few days ago, DO NOT run PT1 dterm on 32khz! It is quite likely to launch your quad at full throttle! Found that out on my first attempt 8k/8k on the other hand is absolutely stunning! 10/10 would recommend! Here's a boring few clips from about the only spot I really get a chance to fly, feel free to skip it:https://youtu.be/3KZlI8F0ER8 Boris' response: Looking great indeed! It basically all comes down to filter interaction. There is no 32k magic at all. Any kind of bench test didn't show any performance gain going to 32khz update speed for motors. But 32k mode fully disables any kind of internal gyro filtering, while 8k mode still has a 256hz lo-wpass active. The 256hz low-pass is kind of just not enough filtering by itself so it needs a tiny bit of software assistance like pt1 ans you get the best balance of filtering without much signal damage. 32k mode, which essentially only has internal 3600hz low-pass active needs a lot of software assistance to make it useful. The betaflight philosophy has been more to make every-bodies quad fly without damaging their gear and that meant filter protection against any common oscillation scenarios. So with all default soft filters on top of it you were still able to fly 32k mode and it felt a bit better than 8k modes as there was simply less filtering. It is not just delays we are here talking about. What is more important is the amount of signal deformation on sharp changes like what you can get in propwash cases or other very quick changing frequencies. What is the difference between PT1 vs BIQUAD filters​ Answer by pete_oz: A biquad filter is more aggressive (it can filter the noise better at the cost of extra delay). I have no technical expertise to explain how each filter works (perhaps others can explain it for us) but basically based on latest Boris's recommendation we should be using PT1 unless there is too much noise on your copter. Answer by ctzsnooze: PT1 is a standard -6db/octave 'infinite impluse type' IIR type low pass filter. Signal amplitude is halved at the set frequency and then is reduced by a factor of four times each time frequency doubles above that. Delay is approximately 1ms at 100Hz (2ms at 50Hz etc). Phase shift is 45 degrees at cutoff frequency. This filter is the digital equivalent of a simple analog low pass RC filter. BiQuad is a steeper -12dB/octave low pass filter. Signal amplitude is halved at the set frequency and then is reduced by a factor of 8 times each time frequency doubles above that. The 'cost' is that delay and phase shift is doubled. Delay is approximately 2ms at 100Hz (4ms at 50Hz etc). Phase shift is 90 degrees at cutoff frequency (I think that's correct). Basically twice as steep a cut, but more delay. Answer by Boris: Ctznooze explained it already, but here a very easy explanation for those who don't understand how filters work. PT1 is a less good filter, but therefore much faster than BIQUAD. Dterm speed of reaction gets greatly improved with PT1 therefore and the pid controller gets a faster reaction in quick disturbance cases. The main performance difference comes into play during very rapid accelerations and decelerations of gyro changes. You could say that rising and falling edge scenarios from gyro changes are better followed with PT1 than with any other higher order filter. Though BIQUAD coefficients also can be modified to be same to PT1. What is the difference between the gyro notch and the D-term notch?​ Answer by Boris: Gyro notch is applies to gyro input and dterm notch on dterm output. But those are in line. Gyro noise at 300hz will also result to dterm noise at 300hz Loop: Gyro-&gt;PID-&gt;motors And again How should I set Dterm Notch Filter? Do I set it to the same value as Gyro Notch Filter e.g. 285Hz?​ Answer by pete_oz: It's difficult to answer this question because in BB spectro analysis we are unable to produce spectro graph that would show us state of noise after gyro notch filters were applied but before D notch filter is applied. We can see spectro graph before gyro notches are removed (&quot;pre-notch&quot;) and can only compare it gyro spectrum graph after all filters (incl. D notch) are applied. In order to be able to identify this better the developers would have to implement debug mode that would allow us to see state of noise after gyro notch filters but before d notch filter is applied. I remember someone was requesting this functionality on Github but the request was dismissed with explanation given (please don't quote me this) that D term noise pattern is identical to that of gyro noise except for the magnitude of the noise. When asking same question in the past (how to set my D notch filtering) I believe I was given the answer to set my D notch filtering for example between my 2 gyro notches (if I have a gap there) or otherwise set it to where I have most noise. Answer by ctzsnooze: Well, first get the noise level under control with basic filtering (no notch filters at all). By that I mean, configure the basic gyro filter appropriately, either BiQuad or PT1, until your P trace on blackbox is 'smooth enough'. If the P trace has a prominent noise peak, apply a gyro notch filter to specifically block that out - but only if the amplitude is big enough that you can see it in the P trace itself. If the noise is less than 1% of signal, like if you can't really see it in P trace compared to signal, ignore the spectrum and don't use any notch. If you need two gyro notch filters for speciific gyro peaks, use them. After doing all this, then look at the Dterm trace. You must have some basic Dterm filtering. If the Dterm trace appears to have less than a few percent noise, you don't need to do anything, you could conceivably use less filtering an get better performance. If you have a broad band of noise on D, then you may need to lower the overall D lowpass or use a BiQuad on D. Only then would you think about adding a D notch filter, and only to deal with a very specific peak that had got through the gyro notch filters. Finally check the motor traces at different stages in a typical flight. Provided that oscillations are less than a couple of percent, they can basically be ignored. We are not trying to get a flat spectrum, just to make it so that signal to motors is 'clean enough'. If we filter super hard, we may get rid of high frequency noise, but may end up exaggerating low frequency wobbles. There is some 'sweet spot', and it differs according to what you want to achieve. Full optimization simply can't be done without a blackbox, quite a lot of time, and knowing what you're doing. Think of it like you are reprogramming the ECU of your car. Also be aware that if you change your props, if they get some nicks or bends, or if you get a little bearing wear, or even if you just change ESCs, all your careful optimizations done with clean new original gear won't work so well. Reducing filtering to the bare minimum, keeping motors perfect, and only flying clean props = fantastic performance and hardly any propwash wobble (assuming light props, low rotational mass, and free-revving powerful motors). For me, I'd rather fly. I set my filters relatively quite low, and don't care much about a little propwash. Motors stay cool, tolerate bent props really well, don't get burning hot at the drop of the hat. Turn P down on more powerful setups. But yeah, I get propwash on hard 180 stops, so I just live with it and learn to fly smoother arcs :-) No one should use motor signal as the input source in blackbox when modifying filters. Pterm noise is the same as gyro noise multiplied by your P factor. In BlackBox, gyro or P traces should be used as the input source for tuning gyro filters. Dterm noise can only be evaluated using the Dterm trace in BlackBox logs. Be aware that Dterm is calculated after all the gyro filtering, so always first optimise the gyro filters, then worry about Dterm filtering independently. A Dterm notch should only be used when there remains a peak in Dterm and where that peak is of such magnitude to be a significant contributor in terms of your final result. Otherwise don't use it at all. Just randomly setting the Dterm notch in-between the gyro notches is not likely to work well. By comparing noise levels and spectrum between P and D in blackbox, it's actually quite easy to visualise what the Dterm filtering is doing. And of course you can turn it off and do a short test run :-) just not for long or you may overheat. The only role that the motor traces have is to look at your overall 'end result' - to visually quantify the amount of energy in oscillations of any kind, with the goal of keeping the total oscillation energy low enough to be not a practical issue. They should not be used as a blackbox input when tuning filters. Comment by zenkinsw: I'm not too technical but once I switched D lowpass to Pt1 it does handle windy days much better, P hunts much less, and less prop wash too, basically less bumpy fly, but trade off with some more D noises motor get hotter. I think people want to try PT1 need to lower down D back to around 24 first, tune it like the old days, actually I found much better as I know when to stop adding numbers lol, also with dshot much easy to see over Dgains symptoms so you know when to back down. For racing I think Biquad still best if don't mind a touch of prop wash but benefits will more efficient and faster motors. How do I see the dterm trace? Roll/pitch D graph in BB log??​ Answer by ctzsnooze: Yep, click on the icon at the right near the parameter to select that one. For Dterm just graph it, select either roll or pitch (they can be different). Remember that you can scroll to a 'start' point in the log, press 'i' on the keyboard, then scroll a bit further on, press 'o' on the keyboard... now your graph only shows that region of the log. Very, very useful. Allows you to look at hover throttle, mid throttle, high throttle independently, often the peaks are different at different RPM. Looking at noise throughout the entire trace is OK but it can be more productive to focus on the throttle range you care about most (or the range with the most noise). Be sure to edit your BBLog settings to disable all expo and set all gains to 100% in the first instance. Expo on BBLog traces is very confusing, much better disabled. (S &amp; X keys) Finally, use the spectrum only to determine the relative distribution of the frequencies, not the absolute magnitude of the noise. In other words, do not worry about the absolute 'height' of the spectrum. It is always bigger if you include more data. For the same included amount of time, a bigger spectrum means more noise, but you must select the same length range to do valid comparisons. To evaluate the overall magnitude of noise, look at the Motors traces - the wiggly lines themselves - with no expo and 100% scale. Eyeball how much noise you reckon there is, as a proportion of the total motor signal itself.

Nowadays most do soft mounting so removing of filters can easily improve performance. The defaults are optimized for hard mounted medium noisy environment for safety. The best tuning performance is achieved with as less Du. I think best filter removal steps would be. set d_lowpass_type = PT1 should always be done first and I think possible on every setup. If it is still fine then: Remove notch 1 Than if still fine remove notch 2 Now if your setup is still clean you could even remove dterm notch. That will give you the best results. Sharpest response, easiest tuning and literally no prop wash on good setups. Note that default betaflight filters are made so every beginner can put a quad in air without burning his gear. Post by ctzsnooze When Boris was first putting notch filters into betaflight they were intended as narrow, specific point filters, to block tight peaks of noise - and for this they are really, really good. However, when set wide, and particularly if set wide with a low cutoff, they do have a 'tail' that causes both delay and phase shift. Those negative effects can extend some way below the lower cutoff point, especially if the filter is 'wide', ie there is a big difference between centre point and low point. For example, setting a notch centre point to 200 and its low point at 100 will have significant effects below 100, whereas setting it to centre of 200 and low point of 160 won't be nearly as much of a problem. Notch filters should be used primarily to control tall, discrete 'peaks' of noise, and only made just wide enough to control the peak. post by r.a.v.​ As explained earlier PT1 is a first order filter and biquad is a second order filter. A main difference is also how steep the cutoff of the filter is. Here's a graph that shows the difference between the two. (X is frequency in Hz, Y is magnitude in dB). You can see that the biquad does not influence frequencies below the cutoff as much as the pt1 filter, but much stronger above. Keep in mind that changes in rx input come in at 9ms = 111Hz and influence the D-term based on setpoint rate which is calculated before the filter is applied, so that could explain why pt1 feels better than biquad. If we combine the filters on gyro with the filters on D, we get something like a 2-3 order filter but with weird behavior on magnitude below the cutoff value. (The coefficients should be changed to get a proper behavior when cascading filters.) So there is not only a phase shift between P and D, but also a large difference in magnitude. Instead of disabling notch filters. I'd recommend raising the cutoff of the D low pass filter. By moving the pt1 cutoff higher and using notches, noise is reduced a lot without influencing lower frequencies. As an example this is what I use on my super noisy noise-o-copter and get cool motors: gyro filter: biquad at 110Hz gyro notch1: 330, cut 250 gyro notch2: 250, cut 170 dterm: pt1 170Hz dterm notch: 280, cut 160 All the filters and signal sources interact with each other and it's difficult to find the perfect setting. Here's my point of view. We have:&lt; 110Hz: Useful, important signals &gt; 200Hz: Motor noise / frame resonance / unwanted signals  Gyro filters: lpf, notch1, notch2 Dterm filters: lpfD, notchD Signal path is like this: gyro -&gt; lpf -&gt; notch1 -&gt; notch2 -&gt; P term -&gt; motor gyro -&gt; lpf -&gt; notch1 -&gt; notch2 -&gt; D term -&gt; lpfD -&gt; notchD -&gt; motor Each filter creates more delay the stronger it is. We want to: keep total delay as low as possible keep delay between P-&gt;motor and D-&gt;motor as low as possible filter out as much noise as possible lpf of second order (biquad) creates most delay but has a steep curve and does not influence frequencies below cutoff too much. lpf of first order (PT1) creates less delay than biquad, but has a strong influence on lower frequencies. Notches are great to remove certain frequencies created by motors and have a delay based on filter width but less than lpf. In my opinion it's best to use biquad and notches for gyro. This does a great job at removing noise but keeping the useful data. The dterm needs still additional filtering so a PT1 at high cutoff and another notch take care of noise without touching low frequency data. This also keeps the delay between D and P low. The default setting of a biquad for D with quite low cutoff creates a lot of delay and also lower magnitude of useful data. post by ctzsnooze on Evaluating and setting Filter: Summary: Raw gyro spectrum shows what is happening without any filtering at all.Normal gyro spectrum shows what happens after gyro LPF and the gyro notch filters.Spectrum from D trace shows how the D calculation adds noise on top of the filtered gyro data. To see what D is 'adding', we compare the spectrum from the D trace (in any given axis) with the gyro spectrum on that axis. We look to see what the D calculation 'adds on'. It usually amplifies noise, progressively more at higher frequencies. That's why D MUST have at least a PT1 low pass filter, and why if there is any high frequency peak creeping through gyro, it will be even bigger in D. The D notch should be applied to that final remaining notch after your gyro notches, or if you have no gyro notches, to deal with whatever is the biggest notch getting through the gyro filtering into D. That's why I say, always, always always get the gyro filters right first, then look at the D filters.finally, PIDsum and motor trace spectrums shows what the motors finally receive; this is the sum of the gyro-&gt;P and gyro-&gt;D pathways added together and modified by your P and D weightings. Remember that we are not 'trying to fix a spectrum'. Our goal is to reduce the relative amount of noise in the signal going to the motors - say as a percentage of total signal to the motors - to a reasonable level. Therefore the final step is to visually examine the motors trace (with scaling at 100% and no expo in the blackbox config), and check that overall the noise contribution is small. It does not have to be zero, just small enough to not be more than say a few percent, ideally. 5% noise costs 5% power and gives you 5% heat. The less noise, the better, all things being equal. You can look at the motors spectrum to see, if there remains a bit more noise present than you want, what its frequency range is. Then you can go back through the pathway to find where best to deal with it. The purpose of the spectrum and the filtering options is to identify the frequencies that contribute to the noise, so that you can then then to set the cut points on the LPF's to get rid of most of it, then add, if needed, the notch filters to remove any stubborn remaining peaks. But you don't need to put a notch on a peak if the actual amount of noise from that peak that is actually present on the motor trace - the waveform itself - is so small as to be irrelevant. We aren't fixing a spectrum! Note that as you reduce filtering, the quad will become 'twitchier'. Reducing filtering means that P and D now are active in higher frequencies that they never 'saw' before. So the quad may fly a bit better perhaps, but may also resonate or go insane from feedback when it didn't used to. The whole goal of filtering is to allow more P and more D than you other wise could use without filtering. And we want more P and more D, if possible, because they are good for propwash. We want the highest P and D possible without overheating motors. But, reducing filtering may limit how much P and D you can safely run without overheating. It's just not true to suggest that 'less filtering means better performance', especially if it limits how much P and D you can run. If you have beat up old machines and dodgy props, you will be able to safely run them on quite high P and D with solid filtering. Somewhere there is a good balance between too much and not enough filtering. Finding the balance that works best for you is what its about. "},{"title":"Frame and Prop Resonance​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Gyro and Dterm Filtering Recommendations","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Gyro-&-Dterm-Filtering-Recommendations#frame-and-prop-resonance","content":"Posted by ctzsnooze: There is a lot of confusion about resonance. Frame resonance is completely independent of props. It’s an intrinsic characteristic of the frame. All frames have a natural resonant frequency. At that point, the frame starts to exaggerate how much it shakes in response to the input. Let's say you have a source of shaking that varies in frequency - for instance, an out of balance prop. As the motors go faster, the frequency of the shaking gets higher. That’s our ‘input’. At the frame’s resonant frequency, the frame will shake much more than at any other rpm. Even though the ‘input’ itself hasn’t changed in magnitude, the frame resonance makes it seem like it has. A very hard frame won't resonate until the frequencies are very high, but a softer frame with heavier motors will have a lower resonant frequency. Resonant frame problems will be exaggerated if the arm can flex, ie it is loose at the bolts, or is beginning to fail, or is thin. However you get real issues when the resonant point of the frame coincides with the resonant point of the prop - and then when the PID loop amplifies the whole thing even more. That’s because prop blades have their own resonant frequency, independent of the frame. Hold a prop hard on a table-top and 'pluck' the blade, and you will hear it. Stiffer props make a higher pitched sound, the frequency you hear is approximately the resonant frequency of the prop. You can also pluck the arms of the quad in the same way to hear their natural resonant frequency. If the prop resonant frequency and the frame resonant frequency happen to be very similar, then you can get sudden severe resonance problems. A good way to determine if this is happening is to hand hold the quad and run the motors with props on in the motors tab. Take care. You can then feel (and hear and see if the accelerometer is on) how each motor individually shakes the frame, and if there is some point where the whole thing shakes much more than any other, that’s the resonant point of the system. By testing individual motors you can tell which motor or motors are providing the greatest input stimulus (i.e. has the biggest problem. You can also test with all motors on at once, which tells you the overall smoothness of the whole frame. Note that in the motors tab the PID loop will not amplify anything; what you feel there is purely mechanical without PID amplification. The whole idea of notch filtering is to precisely match the centre of the notch filter exactly to a specific resonant point, and make it only wide enough to cover the width of the resonant peak. To do this we have to precisely know what the resonant points are, so we need a blackbox, and to look at the various traces carefully. As I explained before, a resonant peak on P needs a gyro notch, then re-log and check if D is still a problem. Usually D is the main resonance amplifier. Without blackbox or notches, it is simpler to just put a steeper low pass on D i.e. biquad at a low frequency (70) rather than worrying about D notches. Also, If gyro is filtered properly with suitable gyro notches, you won’t need a D notch since nothing is coming into D at the resonant point. Unfortunately there is no way to predict the resonant points for your frame, since they differ from prop to prop and frame to frame. The only way is to blackbox it and individualize the filters. In the case we are discussing, the only notch filter that was in use was a D filter, and it was achieving nothing because there was no resonant point at its centre frequency. Notch filters have to be tuned specifically prop by prop and frame by frame. Note that the notch filters do not stop the shaking or the resonance. What they do is stop the PID loop from positively feeding back and amplifying that resonance. The result is less overall shaking. When done properly, the quad itself will shake just as much as it did when driven from the motors tab, but not more. Then if you have a minor prop imbalance, the frame will still shake and resonate, maybe badly, but you should be able to keep flying and your motors won't get hot or sound bad. It would still be good to fix the bearings or replace the bent prop, but at least you can keep flying in the meantime. That’s the whole idea behind notch filtering; blackbox logs are the only way to do them properly, the defaults most likely are wrong, and it absolutely must be individualized per prop and per frame. PS - also there are certain points in BLHeli where the motors are not controlled as smoothly as other points. If you spool motors slowly up without props in the motors tab you will hear them - it just sounds gritty. You can feel it (and see it if the accelerometer is enabled). Sometimes these points provide another trigger for resonance. If the rotational speed of the motors at these points coincides with other resonances you then get issues at those throttle points that aren't apparent elsewhere. continued experiments and discussion from ctzsnooze:​ Spent half the day messing with filters and logging stuff. Bluejay F4 board, O ring mounted with beveled overdrilled holes (not a super soft mount, but not hard either), Tornado T2's. I'd previously optimised P and D, was trying a 'from the very basics' test of a range of filter strategies. I tried arming with only PT1 both at 130 on Gyro and D, and with no notches at all. Terrible grinding noise at idle! Log shows massive but really tightly defined sine wave peak at 180Hz. Looking at the props I can see them flexing like crazy, with so much energy that the frame flex makes the prop nuts are a little blurry. At slightly lower lowpass settings, but still with no notches at all, I can throttle up past this and the motors run smoothly... So I was sitting there, wondering what to try next, flicking the ends of the props (stiff 50403's), and I noticed that they have a musical 'note'. A fundamental frequency. I wondered what frequency that was? Recorded the plucked prop sound, checked its frequency - guess what, nearly exactly 180Hz. Hmm! Got some cyclones, which I use sometimes, they 'pluck' at 300Hz (stiffer). So I stuck a gyro filter with midpoint 180 and low point at 140 and bingo no more shaking - able to bring the lowpass values up quite high now. So I made another profile for cyclones with the notch centred around 300. Same outcome! I also noticed that with PT1 on both gyro and D, the proportion of noise on D compared to P becomes progressively greater as frequency increases. To keep the two in a constant relationship, a biquad on D works much better. Once the amplitudes of P and D sort of are the same, we only need to put notches in the right place on gyro, and none are needed on D. So I ended up with PT1 on gyro, biquad on D, and just a single gyro notch to suit the exact prop resonance point, nothing else. Flew great! I set both lowpass points at the same frequency, and tested higher and lower. Too high (with high PIDs), and the shakes would reappear either side of the gyro notch! Clearly there was some upper value where there was so little filtering that even good props would feedback and shake, and there also was a lower bound were bad props were happily tolerated. Since I often re-use not so great props, and 'fly home' with bent ones often enough, I went for lower filters. I ended up with both lowpass filters cutting from 80, PT1 on gyro and biquad on Dterm, a single gyro notch at 140/180 (for light but stiff 50403's), P around 40-50 and D around 25. I'd recommend this as a basic starting 'recipe' from which one could lift the lowpass values later. At least one notch needs to match the prop resonance, so go pluck your prop! :-) Quick description by ctzsnooze of measuring Prop Resonance: Get a representative prop, hold the hub hard onto a firm table, with one blade poking out over the edge. Try to dull the other blades so they don't rattle. Plucking the blade itself takes some practice to get a good sound, a clean flick up from below should make a smooth clean tone. There are quite a few Audio FFT apps that record a short sample and present a 3D FFT with the noise peak highlighted; ideally one where you can scroll back looking for the peak. Usually quite easy to identify, there will be one big sine wave peak that fades out like a guitar string being plucked. iAnalyzer Lite on iOS for example. The predominant sine-wave like frequency is the fundamental resonant frequency of the prop, and works really well as the main notch filter value. Completely stops grinding on idle on all my quads that had it, first time. Video- How to Quickly Find Natural Resonant Frequency of a Propeller. Uses the app: FFT spectrum analyzer ​ More from ctzsnooze:​ True motor noise (bearings, out of balance bells, loose bolts, out of balance props, etc) is typically a sort of random junk broadly spread over a range of frequencies from low to high, occasionally with some small peaks, but basically a smooth spread. The actual frequency of this noise at any point in time correlates with motor rpm. A single out of balance bell or prop will induce sine wave shaking of the frame and the frequency will increase as rpm increases. Obviously all motors make some shaking and noise, and the frequency obviously changes during the flight. The key thing is that noise from bearings or out of balance props / motor bells will be rpm dependent and will vary in frequency. Low pass filters deal very well with noise over a broad spread of frequencies going from low to high. A notch only takes out a tiny piece of it, leaving the rest untouched. If out of balance motor noise coincides with the natural resonant frequency of a prop, arm or other frame component, it will become greatly exaggerated... Resonance is a definite 'noise' peak at a specific frequency. It really isn't random noise at all, it's a sine wave type pattern in the black box traces, and a definite tall peak in the spectrum. Generally it is at prop resonance frequency, or less commonly at the natural resonant frequency of (say) a loose or flexy arm or excessively soft motor mount. The resonant frequency does not change much with motor rpm, but may be triggered at specific rpm. The more aggressive your PIDs, the faster responding the ESCs and motors, the flexier the frame and the motor mounts, the bigger and stronger this resonance will be. Resonant peaks are best dealt with using a notch filter at the exact resonant point. When prop resonance is triggered, the frequency is relatively focused around the natural resonant frequency of the props. This can happen at idle, or at certain rpm points, or just be there all the time randomly. The props can resonate at nearby frequencies too, just not as well as the dead centre of their resonant point, so the peak can be wide or narrow. If there is a dominant peak, the auto setting filters being developed for 3.2 may be able to find that automatically. In the meantime, for people without blackbox, a single gyro notch set at your prop resonant point (with the low point about 25% lower) is a very good starting point for a single notch / PT1 setup. If you are experimenting with PT1 only low pass and minimal notch setups, this is what I would do: Set both gyro and D to PT1 at about 100, disable all notch filters except just one. Measure your prop resonance, and set that single gyro notch at the prop resonance point, low side 25% below centre point, and check that the quad flies OK. If the motors are too hot, my next step, rather than adding notches, would be to shift to biquad on D, since in nearly every log I've seen with broad motor noise, heat is mostly generated by D amplification at higher frequencies, and a biquad on D is the most effective method for dealing with this problem. That's my starting point, anyway. Posted by ctzsnooze​ There are a number of formulas that calculate phase shift vs frequency for various filters, including notches. For lowpass filters, the delay in ms is intrinsically linked to the cutoff frequency and is more commonly expressed in terms of phase shift. For our PT1 (one pole) type lowpass filters, phase shift is 45 degrees or 1/8th of the wavelength at cutoff frequency. If we set the cutoff frequency to 125Hz, where the wavelength is 8ms, our delay will be 1ms; if we set a PT1 to 62.5Hz, delay will be 2ms. For biquads we just double the delay, ie 2ms at 125Hz and 4ms at 62.5Hz. For notch filters, the delay is more complex, and is especially troublesome if set wide and low. I think that our notch filters cause phase shift of 45 degrees at their -3dB low point and 90 degrees at centre. Because the centre is not always twice the low point, there is no simple numerical 'delay' equivalent. However, if we have the low point of a notch at 125hz and centre at 250, the implied delay for both points is 1ms. But if the centre point is closer to the low point, the delay is no longer a simple time but is frequency dependent. Notch filters carry their phase shift / delay effect lower and deeper than simple low pass filters. Note that in both cases, the higher the filter frequencies can go, the less delay we get. And that each filter adds its own delay, in series; they add up. We can very easily accumulate 7-8ms delay from strong filtering (especially on D). That delay is simply massive when compared to gyro update and PID recalculation rates happening more than 50 times faster, ie every 0.125ms at 8k/8k. It's why a machine with lots of filtering has problems with propwash, and in terms of propwash actually won't handle any better than 2k2k. For D to work properly, the phase relationship between P and D must be preserved. When we filter D with a biquad + notch we offset D significantly and wreck those phase relationships. Softmounting the FC will make it harder for noise to be transmitted via the bolts to the gyro chip, hopefully so that less software filtering is required. For this to work, a mechanical equivalent of whatever electronic filtering you took away is needed, and that's difficult to achieve in a controllable fashion. In any case, if the FC mounting was soft enough to cut high frequencies as effectively as our low pass filters, it will inevitably incur delays of comparable magnitude. Soft mounting motors if done effectively can result in reduced noise transmission into the frame without significantly negatively impacting the time taken for the motor to generate thrust. In principle this is very appealing. However if too soft the motor can process and wobble in the mounts, causing larger scale low frequency shaking than would otherwise happen. This limits how soft they can be. And the entire bolt needs to be isolated from the frame to be effective. If most of the noise can pushed upwards into a range well above the frequencies we care about, the filtering we apply can be less intensive, causing less delay. Super stiff frames, effective motor soft mounts, stiff props, high rpm setups, tight bearings, no shaft travel, perfectly balanced props, exactly equal thrust per blade, and perfect ESCs all play a part in shifting the noise spectrum higher and higher and reducing the amount of noise to be filtered. For my race quads I've largely given up on getting rid of propwash. I filter heavily so I can fly with beat up props and smashed up motors and light-weight arms that have a bit of flex, that gives me heaps of propwash. But if I wanted a super smooth freestyle quad, or spent more money on new props and motors all the time, I'd set up a stiff quad as above and would get a very different propwash experience.

Posted by ctzsnooze: Switching from biquad to PT1 , while leaving frequency the same, say at 100Hz, will do the following: Twice as much noise at 200hz Four times as much noise at 400hz Almost no change in phase delay at 10hz About 15 degrees less phase delay at 50hz 45 degrees less phase delay at 100hz The improvement in phase delay at 100hz can be thought of as about 1.5ms less absolute delay.

As you can see the delay is very low but the strong filtering allows higher cutoff for lpf filters. So total delay of notch + high cutoff lpf is lower than lpf alone with low cutoff while the noise is still reduced significantly.

But there are a couple of steps required to make the Betaflight configurator work on linux: Linux requires udev rules to allow write access to USB devices for users. If you are not familiar with udev rules don’t worry, we will walk you through the process in the proceeding steps using the command line interface (CLI). Note: you might need to install libatomic: $ sudo apt install libatomic1  Step 0:​ Without next command the configurator will not launch on at least ubuntu 20.04 and higher $ sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER  Step 1:​ Since we will be using the CLI, simply copy and paste this command into your terminal, it will create the required file for you: (echo '# DFU (Internal bootloader for STM32 and AT32 MCUs)' echo 'ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;usb&quot;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&quot;2e3c&quot;, ATTRS{idProduct}==&quot;df11&quot;, MODE=&quot;0664&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot;' echo 'ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;usb&quot;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&quot;0483&quot;, ATTRS{idProduct}==&quot;df11&quot;, MODE=&quot;0664&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot;') | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/45-stdfu-permissions.rules &gt; /dev/null  The file created is /etc/udev/rules.d/45-stdfu-permissions.rules, which is used when your flight controller is in DFU mode. Step 2:​ Make sure you've got permissions to access your flight controller in non-DFU mode (borrowed from https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Allowing-your-linux-userid-permission-to-use-your-usb-device): Note: This example assumes that you know the device name of you USB device and that your userid has sudo privileges. In this example our Linux userid is user and we are on the server called machine. Our USB device is called /dev/ttyUSB0. Check the current permissions and owner/group of the device. [user@machine ~]$ ls -la /dev/ttyUSB0 crw-rw----. 1 root dialout 188, 0 Apr 3 21:16 /dev/ttyUSB0 For this configuration, the owner is root, the group is dialout and both the owner/group have read/write permissions. What you need to do is make your login userid part of the group associated with the USB device. For this case, we add the group dialout to our userid user using the usermod command. This command requires root privileges to run. [user@machine ~]$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout user You will need to log out then log back in and now you should have access to the device. If you are still not added to the dialout group (you can check that using the groups command), try restarting your system. Troubleshooting installation problems:​ If you see your ttyUSB device disappear right after the board is connected, chances are that the ModemManager service (that handles network connectivity for you) thinks it is a GSM modem. If this happens, you can issue the following command to disable the service: sudo systemctl stop ModemManager.service  If your system lacks the systemctl command, use any equivalent command that works on your system to disable services. You can likely add your device ID to a blacklist configuration file to stop ModemManager from touching the device, if you need it for cellural networking, but that is beyond the scope of cleanflight documentation. If you see the ttyUSB device appear and immediately disappear from the list in Cleanflight Configurator when you plug in your flight controller via USB, chances are that NetworkManager thinks your board is a GSM modem and hands it off to the ModemManager daemon as the flight controllers are not known to the blacklisted Sometimes, after other programs (configuration scripts, ESC firmware uploaders) have used the port that your flight controller is recognised as, and (i.e. /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0), and change modes on the port without resetting them. This leaves the configurator unable to connect to the flight controller, even after unplugging / replugging the USB cable. In this situation, the following command will reset the port settings to defaults: stty sane -F /dev/&lt;your port&gt;  "},{"title":"Diagnosing if your CPU is dead, or just missing firmware (Blue LED of Death)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Installing Betaflight","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Installing-Betaflight#diagnosing-if-your-cpu-is-dead-or-just-missing-firmware-blue-led-of-death","content":"The symptoms between a fried CPU, and a CPU that is missing firmware is almost identical, with the exception that it is impossible to flash firmware to a dead CPU. CPUs may arrive from the manufacture dead, die when it first powers on do to a manufacturing defect, or die when if you wire up your board incorrectly (e.g. connect the 5v rail or battery power to a UART port). When a CPU dies, you may or may not see magic smoke. The STM32 chipset requires 3.3v of power to operate, and so on-board dedicated voltage regulators are required to provide stable power to the CPU during operation. Since this is usually the only thing on the board requiring this voltage, you can determine if the CPU is fried using the following two methods: Use a multimeter to measure the resistance between the 3.3v pad on your flight controller, and any ground pin on the board. The resistance should be in the mid to high kilo-ohm range if the CPU is operational. The resistance will be near zero (1-3 ohms) if the CPU is dead.If you do not have a multimeter available, find the 3.3v voltage regulator on your flight controller, and connect it to power (i.e. USB). If the temperature remains low (about 30C), then the flight controller is probably okay. If temperatures rise quickly (between 80-150C), then the CPU is probably dead.

Yaw gyro changes happen primarily due to inertia when the rpm of the motors change. A constant acceleration of yaw requires a constant rate of increase/decrease in the rpm of the yaw motor pairs. This means that on Yaw I has the effect of P and P the effect of D. FF is a control element that adds impetus based on the acceleration in setpoint rate. This results in several issues on yaw. Typically yaw will react very fast initially, then fall back and catch up again over time. Integrated Yaw fixes this by integrating the output of the yaw pid before applying them to the mixer. This normalizes the way the pids work. You can now tune as any other axis. It requires use of absolute control since no I is needed with Integrated Yaw.

Make sure I is low or zero since significant I leads to strong oscillations. Pitch and roll might require slight retuning - primarily reducing I a bit since absolute control acts similar to a second I term.  To be noted: There is no more I and maybe it doesn't make sense anymore, but in the past the CLI Command set iterm_relax=RPY  was mandatory.

"},{"title":"Parameters:​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Launch Control","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Launch-Control#parameters","content":"launch_control_mode: Allows NORMAL (default), PITCHONLY, and FULL. NORMAL: designed for launching off the ground balanced on a bottom-mount battery. Roll and pitch will hold position. Yaw control is available but the PID controller will not attempt to hold yaw position.PITCHONLY: for use with race launch stands or possibly off the gound with top-mount batteries. Disables roll and yaw completely. Also the front motors are kept at idle to minimize chances of falling off the stand. Do not use this mode if trying to balance off a battery as the quad will fall forward since the front motors will not react.FULL: Like NORMAL but adds position holding for yaw as well. Use care with this option as yaw tends to windup if left too long. launch_trigger_allow_reset: Allows OFF and ON (default). Determines the launch triggering reset behavior. After a launch is triggered we want to disable the feature so that if the pilot crashes and then re-arms Launch Control will not be active. ON: Allows the pilot to reset the Launch Control trigger by turning the mode switch off and back on again while disarmed. Use this method if you've configured your mode switch in such a way that you can optionally enable it.OFF: Launch Control cannot be reset and will be disabled until a power cycle or flight controller reboot. This method should be used if you can't independently disable the mode like if it's enabled all the time or tied to the arming switch. As long as the launch has not been triggered the pilot can arm/disarm multiple times and the feature will still be available. So if the quad was to fall off the blocks for example the pilot can reposition and simply re-arm. launch_trigger_throttle_percent: Allows 0 - 90 (default 20). Adds a throttle deadband below which Launch Control will be active. The launch will be triggered once throttle exceeds the configured percent. Higher values provide a more aggressive launch as the throttle will &quot;jump&quot; to the configured percentage. Setting to 0 will cause the trigger to be min_check. The default value of 20 provides a good initial deadband to prevent accidental triggering while still providing a good &quot;jump&quot; off the blocks. Be careful with higher values as the quad can be quite aggressive when launching. launch_control_gain: Allows 0 - 200 (default 40). Determines the Iterm gain used to hold position. If the quad has difficulty holding position then increase this value. Be careful with high values as windup can occur. If you hear the motors continuing to speed up while position is being held then the gain is likely too high. Basically you want to use the lowest value that works acceptably. While raised up in the launch position it's normal for the quad to move around a little. In this position it's very susceptible to wind in particular. Normally a little motion won't be a problem and it's not necessary to try to tune this with increased gain.

If only 1 axis asks for full authority the result will be exactly same like with LINEAR mixer. The optimal results are achieved, when multiple axes are requesting authority. Short summary of differences between mixers: LEGACY tries to keep requested throttle position as long as possible, till the point where it cannot maintain current throttle position it will drastically start to change throttle to still get desired authority. That is also the reason of sharper transition. LINEAR will start changing throttle earlier in order to prevent these steep transitions at the end. In other words it smooths out the thrust increase/decrease for desired correction. DYNAMIC This is another experimental mixer variation of mixer from tylercorleone. It behaves very similar to linear mixer, but much smarter. When all of the PIDsum comes from single axis it will behave exactly same as linear mixer, but when PIDsum to mixer is combined from other axes the mixer will adapt itself to stay closer to requested throttle level.

In order to safely fly a backup quad with the primary quad crashed in the field (but powered up) it's necessary to: Disable arming, so that the crashed quad doesn't unintentionally arm when taking off with the backup. This is specifically a problem when a transmitter can send signals to all powered up receivers (like FrSky ACCST D8/D16 and others)and change the VTX to an unused (graveyard) channel with low power output so it doesn't interfere with the backup quad. Betaflight 3.5 introduced a new mode called paralyze which disables arming. It can only be invoked while the quad isn't armed. Paralyze is a sticky mode, so once it's active, the FC has to be power cycled. In order to invoke it, the mode needs to be in a disengaged state at least once, so that forgetting to flip the switch back after crashing doesn't immediately invoke paralyze on the backup quad. Paralyze itself only takes care of preventing arming. To also put the VTX into pit mode and keep it there, you can link it to Paralyze in the CLI: aux 2 39 2 1700 2100 0 45 The aux channel (2 in this case) and the range (1700-2100 here) doesn't matter as 45 at the end of the command means mode 39 (VTX Pit mode) is linked to 45 (Paralyze).

P gain determines how hard the flight controller works to correct error to achieve the desired flight path (i.e. where the pilot wants the quad to go by moving the transmitter sticks). Think of it as a sensitivity and responsiveness setting. The snappy response provided with a high P gain can even make it feel like you have increased your rates. Generally speaking, higher P gain means sharper control while low P gain means softer control. If P is too high, the quadcopter becomes too sensitive and tends to over-correct, eventually it will cause overshoots, and you will have high frequency oscillations. You can lower P to reduce the oscillations, but reduce it too much and your quadcopter will start to feel sloppy. It is proportional to the magnitude of error (setpoint and gyro).

For stick moves, the D-term dampens the command. For an outside influence (prop wash OR wind gust) the D-term dampens the influence. Higher gains provide more dampening and reduce overshoot by P-term and FF. However, the D-term is VERY sensitive to gyro high frequency vibrations (noise | magnifies by 10x to 100x). High frequency noise can cause motor heat and burn out motors if D-gains are too high or the gyro noise is not filtered well (see Filters tab). Think of the D-term as the shock absorber on your car, but with the negative inherent property of magnifying high frequency gyro noise. Too high D-gain can burn your motors!D-gain works as a damper and reduces the over-correcting and overshoots caused by P-term. Like a shock absorber stops the suspension from being bouncy, adding D-gain can “soften” and counteract the oscillations caused by excessive P-gain, as well as minimizing propwash oscillations. When D-term is too low, your quad will have bad bounce-backs at the end of a flip or roll, and you will also experience the worst propwash oscillations in vertical descents. Increasing D-gain can improve these problems, however, an excessive D-gain value can introduce vibration in your quadcopter because it amplifies the noise in the system. Eventually this will lead to motor overheat and quad oscillation. Another side effect of excessive D-term is the decrease in the quad’s response, this effect is often described as “mushy”. set debug_mode=d_min Proportial to the change in magnitude of error Anticipates the future state of the system based on its current movement It reduces the P-term overshoot and oscillation (damping effect) But accelerates the P term too!

P of 4.0 on Pitch and Roll are good starting points. Also lower the I and D gains on pitch and roll in order to tune P with minimal interference from I and D. I of 20 and D of 5 are good starting points. For yaw, it is prudent to decrease default P by HALF and reduce I just a bit, to eliminate that axis as a source of oscillations. Yaw will be tuned last. Over a series of flights, increase P gain on Roll axis until you see oscillations when you approach full throttle and you get very rapid visible and audible shakes. Then set P term to roughly 70% of the value that caused the oscillations. Test to see if the quad holds the desired roll angle and does not drift by rolling the copter to a specific angle, and then punch and drop throttle several times. The angle you gave it relative to the horizon should not change significantly. If the angle appears to drift, increase I gain. If you don't see drift, don't change I. You can change the &quot;feel&quot; of your copter by raising or lowering I after you achieve a good tune. (I does not really affect final P and D values. Increase D gain on each axis ONLY to the extent that it helps reduce bounceback after flips/rolls or prop-wash oscillations after an abrupt descent. If neither is a problem, then LEAVE D LOW. At this point the Copter should be around 80-90% tuned. Note: Too high of D term can cause motors to get hot. Do a short flight, 10-30 seconds, land and check motors. If you can hold your finger on the motors then they are not too hot. Yaw often requires the least tuning, but it may still introduce significant oscillation if you ignore it. Start with the Yaw P that you chopped in half in step one and verify that you do not get significant vibrations when you do a long punch-out or fast forward flight. Start pushing up Yaw P by .5 increments until you start to see roughness through your fpv camera when in fast forward flight or punches. Then decrease a bit. Fine tune by looking at Yaw P term in blackbox. It MAY be oscillating a bit, but pull up the Yaw gyro trace to see if those P oscillations actually make it to the Gyro. If the yaw gyro looks relatively smooth, you're ok. Note: Because yaw inherently has less positive control (a.k.a. authority), than pitch and roll, a wider range of values are acceptable. Relatively higher P and I values and relatively low D values are the norm because of the inherent lack of authority compared to pitch and roll. A blackbox log is usually necessary to fine-tune. Most excess P oscillation comes from either roll or pitch, but if any roughness at full throttle remains, look at a blackbox log to see if yaw P starts to oscillate on full throttle. If so, decrease yaw P. Finally, refine the relationship between P and I by looking for a tendency to resist or &quot;fall into&quot; strong turns. Very low I values will result in an axis that drifts over time. Low I values on an axis will allow that axis to change attitude more freely but may still hold attitude. Higher I values on an axis will hold attitude very well, but may tend to resist movement and can add a feeling of inertia. Very high I values can create an overly &quot;robotic&quot; feeling and even oscillations. Can also refine P by analyzing Blackbox Logs. This may get you closer to a perfect tune. Notes: The undesirable flight characteristic called bounce-back oscillation occurs when you abruptly return the pitch/roll stick to center, and the copter rotation does not make a &quot;clean&quot; stop. It could be the result of: D that is too lowP that is too highor even P that is too low (a low P gain can cause slow, sloppy oscillations because it's not providing enough authority to get to the intended end-state).

To put it simply, if you want sharper response, increase F gain. If you want smoother ending of a rapid movement, increase D gain. The more D, the smoother everything will be, the more F, the more control you will have. If you have oscillation in Yaw, you can try higher F and I values, then drop P to maintain the responsiveness while keeping oscillations caused by P gain to a minimum. The faster the sticks are moving, the more FeedForward we get. FeedForward helps P drive the quad into turns. Unlike P, FeedForward cannot cause oscillation, no matter how much FF is added. With FeedForward, we get better stick responsiveness without pushing P so high as to cause wobbles. It also reduces the delay time between input and response.

With feedforward, the faster the sticks are moved, the bigger the push. And it doesn't wait for any error to develop, the response is instantaneous. The feedforward effect is attenuated around centre sticks by the transition parameter, so the quad can be made more damped (less twitchy) around centre for freestyle type flying by setting transition to 0.5 or 0.1 as usual, but for racing and for direct responses it's best to leave transition at 0.

TPA basically allows an aggressively tuned multi-rotor (one that feels very locked in) to reduce its PID gains when throttle is applied beyond the TPA threshold/breakpoint in order to eliminate fast oscillations tpa_mode: PD/D (Only acts on D-term by default)tpa_rate: TPA 0.6 means 60% PIDs decrease on full throttletpa_breakpoint: TPA breakpoint 1250(25%) - throttle value at wich TPA starts to work  Better propwash (before move D gain up, move TPA up) Throttle Limit never get up to 100% Throttle scale / clipthrottle limit (percentage) Radio Frequencies and Systems Taranis 2,4Ghz (factory standard)Crossfire 900MHz (longer range / more expensive) Analysis Tools Blackbox ExplorerPID ToolboxPlasmatreeblackbox-tools "},{"title":"BLACKBOX EXPLORER​","type":1,"pageTitle":"PID Tuning Guide","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/PID-Tuning-Guide#blackbox-explorer","content":"Use UAV-Tech's JSON File to have the most important views availablehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hWgcADCI3Aa4XLUiGsGQbPHxdkE94taP Holistic Flight performancePID OperationsProp wash eval. * How gyro is following setpoint SAND BOXSmoothingSAND BOXYaw evaluation bounce backs Pitch evaluation bounce backs Roll evaluation bounce backs Noise analysis noise trails Debug mode (to log filter on logger) Mostly set debug_mode = GYRO_SCALED could be used. get debug set gyro_filter_debug_axis = ROLL set rc_smoothing_debug_axis = ROLL set acro_trainer_debug_axis = ROLL set osd_debug_pos = 2049 set debug_mode = GYRO_SCALED set debug_mode=gyro_raw set debug_mode=notch set debug_mode=fft set debug_mode=gyro set debug_mode=dfilter If PID-error is Zero, you have a perfectly tuned quad (also if in windy condition) D-term should be soft (not noisy), otherwise you cant handle Propwash "},{"title":"I-term​","type":1,"pageTitle":"PID Tuning Guide","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/PID-Tuning-Guide#i-term","content":"below zero your quad is more heavy to the rightabove zero your quad is more heavy to the leftcould also occour on windy days (force from outside)is your gyro multiplied by a gain "},{"title":"PID error​","type":1,"pageTitle":"PID Tuning Guide","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/PID-Tuning-Guide#pid-error","content":"is the offset of your setpoint and gyrothe &quot;perfect tuned quad&quot; always has zero PID errorgyro should exactly track setpointbiggest errors occour if you start a sharp pitch or rollpropwash also generates PID errordrives the PID "},{"title":"PID SUM​","type":1,"pageTitle":"PID Tuning Guide","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/PID-Tuning-Guide#pid-sum","content":"is the Setpoint minus Gyro Tuning tricks TL;TR from https://oscarliang.com/quadcopter-pid-explained-tuning/ Tune one axis at a time: first roll, then pitch, and finally yaw Every time you change a value, you should ask yourself: “is it getting better or worse?” Try to find the peak where the quad has the best flight characteristics before performance starts to degrade again. When P-gain is too low: slow oscillation. When P-gain is too high: very fast oscillations. Fine tune it until you get to a point where the quad feels very responsive and nimble, making sure there is no excessive amount of vibration. Also listen to your motors, twitching motors are a sign of excess P gain which might not be visible in the camera. If your quad flies fine in low to mid throttle, but only gets oscillations with high throttle, then increasing TPA will help. Do a punch out and see if there is any fast oscillations, if so, increase TPA. Good TPA will give you a relatively smooth punch out. I personally wouldn’t use TPA higher than 0.4, otherwise your quad might feel “loose” at high throttle. When you do aggressive maneuvers like flips and rolls, and your quad overshoots at the end of the move then bounce back, increase D for the affected axis. Increasing D-gain can also help reduce prop wash (oscillation when you descent). Be careful because excessive D-gain can introduce oscillations to your quad, and also make motors run hot, so use just enough to minimize propwash. Another sign of too much D-term is fast oscillations at the end of a roll or flip. Note that to eliminate bounces at the end of a flip or roll, you can also use Setpoint Transition which we will talk about next. Bank your quad to the left and right to see if it’s holding the angle well. Ideally it should just stay at the same attitude as you release the roll stick. If the quad can’t hold the angle then it’s an indication that I gain is probably too low. Your quad can drift with the wind, so you might want to increase I a bit more on a windy day depending how bad it is. I recommend setting I-term just high enough to stay level, excessively high I gain can result in a stiff, robotic feeling, and even oscillations. Setpoint is the commanded Roll rate.Gyro is tracking Setpoint as good as possible (windy days...)

For example, on Raceband, R1 usually has higher output power than R8. Another thing to take into account is the tuning of your transmitter antenna and receiver antenna. Assuming they are both tuned to 5800MHz, then the performance is going to be better on channel F4 (Fatshark 4) or R5 (Raceband). If they are tuned to 5700MHz, then the best channels would be E1 or R2.

With 3.1, we can easily modify motor mappings with resource CLI command.

Sometimes referred to as a &quot;Tasmanian Devil&quot;, some configuration or hardware issues can cause a violent and dangerous out-of-control spin immediately after arming or as the throttle is raised for takeoff. Some common causes are: Props on incorrectlyMotor order wrongMotors spinning the wrong directionFlight controller (gyro) orientation incorrect This feature is designed to only intervene and auto-disarm during a runaway event on first takeoff after powering up, and should have no impact on normal flight.

The wide range of hardware and variable circumstances mean that there may be cases where this feature may be unable to provide additional protection. As always it is the pilot's responsibility to ensure their aircraft is configured properly and safe to fly. "},{"title":"Operation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Runaway Takeoff Prevention","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Runaway-Takeoff-Prevention#operation","content":"The Runaway Takeoff Prevention feature is enabled by default beginning with Betaflight 3.3. There are two phases of operation: Takeoff: After the first arm after powering up, the feature looks for excessive PID responses that indicate the craft is not responding properly and escalating towards an out-of-control runaway event. If detected the flight controller will automatically disarm. A beep pattern - one long, one short - will indicate that a runaway takeoff event occurred and &quot;RUNAWAY&quot; will be displayed as the arming disabled reason in both the OSD and CLI. Successful Flight: Once the craft successfully takes off and is in controlled flight the feature will deactivate for the remainder of the battery. After that finial successful take-off, the pilot can arm and disarm at any time without re-activating the feature. The detection of successful flight involves looking at throttle level and control stick activity along with the craft responding correctly to the PID controller over a period of time. By deactivating the feature after successful flight is detected we prevent subsequent inadvertent disarming caused by crashes or gate/branch clips. This short video is an example of the feature activating: https://youtu.be/FEczCjAWv_0 Unsuccessful Flight: If triggered, the pilot should disarm immediately. The feature will remain active until a successful flight clears the problem. Re-arming without solving the problem will likely re-trigger the protection. False triggering can, rarely, occur. It can be minimised by modifying the configuration parameters. "},{"title":"Configuration​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Runaway Takeoff Prevention","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Runaway-Takeoff-Prevention#configuration","content":"In general there shouldn't be any need to adjust the configuration parameters. Default values were chosen based on testing and should give good results. However as is always the case, additional testing and feedback from the users may identify some further optimization to these settings. It's anticipated that once the Runaway Takeoff Prevention feature matures that some of the tunable values might be eliminated and replaced with optimized hard-coded values to simplify the configuration. The first group of parameters configure how the feature detects and activates during a runaway takeoff event: runaway_takeoff_prevention = ON Set this to OFF to completely disable the feature. Note that there will be no protection against runaway takeoff events and the firmware will behave as it did before the feature was implemented. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND DISABLING THE FEATURE. Runaway events can be quite violent and personal injury or damage to property can occur for even seemingly minor setup issues like putting the props on incorrectly. The remaining parameters affect the logic used to detect normal controlled flight and deactivate the feature for the remainder of the battery: runaway_takeoff_deactivate_throttle_percent = 25 (reduced to 20 in BF4.0) Determines the minimum throttle percentage threshold where successful flight can be considered. Valid values range from 0 to 100. Along with throttle level the logic also requires activity on the roll, pitch or yaw sticks (minimum 15% deflection) along with the PID controller successfully controlling the craft with the PID_sum staying under control. When these conditions are met the logic accumulates successful flight time. Generally you won't need to adjust this value as most quads require around 25% or more throttle to takeoff/hover. The exception may be if you have and extremely powerful or light craft that is capable of flying well below 25% throttle. In this case you may want to lower this value closer to your actual hover throttle percent. If this value is set too low it's possible that the logic will deactivate too quickly and may not trigger in a real runaway event. Setting it too high will result in the logic taking more flight time to deactivate as it only accumulates flight time when the throttle is above the setting. runaway_takeoff_deactivate_delay = 500 This is the amount of successful flight time in milliseconds that must be accumulated to deactivate the feature. Valid values range from 100 (0.1 seconds) to 1000 (1 second). The default value of 500 (0.5 seconds) seems to be very reliable and shouldn't need to be adjusted. The goal is to deactivate the logic after a &quot;reasonable&quot; but short period of time once we've determined the craft is flying normally. However we want it to deactivate before we might reach the first point where a crash or other event may occur (like at the first gate during a race). Raising this value will delay the deactivation and it's possible that a crash or gate/branch clip could cause an unintended disarm. Lowering this value too much could result in the logic deactivating too soon and not providing protection in a runaway event. It's important to note that the delay is the accumulated amount of flight time where the other criteria like throttle level, stick activity (minimum 15% deflection), etc. are met. Thus the &quot;real&quot; elapsed time before deactivation may be longer than 0.5 seconds if the throttle was dropping below the limit or if the R/P/Y sticks were centered. The actual behavior can be viewed by using blackbox logging - see the debugging section below. "},{"title":"Debugging​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Runaway Takeoff Prevention","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Runaway-Takeoff-Prevention#debugging","content":"Additional data may be captured in a blackbox log that will give insight into the operation of the Runaway Takeoff Prevention feature. Enable capturing this additional data by: set debug_mode = RUNAWAY_TAKEOFF This will enable additional debug values in the log that can be used to observer the operation of the feature. debug[0] - boolean value (0/1) This value indicates whether the feature is active (1) and in detection mode. Once successful flight deactivates the feature the value will be (0). debug[1] - boolean value (0/1) Indicates whether the PID_sum value for some axis has exceeded the runaway_takeoff_threshold and we are in a countdown for runaway_takeoff_activate_delay milliseconds. The logic is preparing to auto-disarm assuming the PID_sum value continues to exceed the threshold. debug[2] - boolean value (0/1) Indicates that the criteria for deactivation (throttle level, stick activity and PID response) has been met and we are accumulating in-flight time. debug[3] - number Indicates the in-flight milliseconds accumulated so far. Once this reaches runaway_takeoff_deactivate_delay the feature will be disabled. Any time debug[2] = 1 then debug[3] will be accumulating time. As the Runaway Takeoff Prevention feature matures based on feedback from the user community the debugging features may become unnecessary and removed to save space some time in the future.

Not really an issue and probably a good thing. Simply don't crash on takeoff. :)Severe bouncing/bumping the ground on takeoff may cause a disarm. This is not actually very likely to occur as it takes a really big hit to trigger the disarm with the default configuration.Arming with no props and moving the R/P/Y sticks significantly may trigger a disarm. This is normal and is caused because the PID controller is trying to control the craft and it's not responding properly (because there are no props!). As a result the PID_sum values will grow as the PID controller begins to push harder and harder to make something happen. This can end up looking like a runaway PID_sum event. The feature has provisions in place to allow limited bench testing without disarming. Heavy yaw movements could still trigger a disarm but generally &quot;wiggling&quot; the sticks to see the motor responses won't be a problem. Testing while connected to the configurator will temporarily disable runaway takeoff prevention and allow unlimited bench testing without props.&quot;Hand flying&quot; with the props off could trigger a disarm. NEVER TRY TO HOLD AN ARMED CRAFT IN YOUR HANDS WHILE THE PROPS ARE ON!! If the props are off and you move the craft around while the motors are spinning the PID controller will oppose the motion but because there are no props the PID_sum value will grow possibly triggering a disarm. On the other hand, holding the craft still while moving the sticks to feel the motor response will not trigger a disarm.

Without any smoothing, the signal going to the motors will be sharp and spiky. Lots of stick movement will then then make motors unnecessarily hot and waste battery power, without achieving anything useful. By appropriately smoothing the RC setpoint changes, these spikes can be rounded off, so the motors sound smoother and don't get so hot. To provide optimal smoothing, the flight controller needs to know the time interval between new data elements. When automatically determining the RC smoothing configuration, Betaflight measures the time between data packets, but does not know how the user has configured the radio link itself. So it currently assumes that SBus and FPort users will have set it to 9ms data intervals, as above, by limiting the number of channels in FrSky X mode to only 8. If users have configured more than 8 channels, they should manually configure the RC smoothing settings and not use the automatic values.

On that basis it will typically set the filter frequency to 50Hz and the older interpolation window to 11ms. Manually setting a lower filter frequency will smooth out the RC input ripple that goes to the motor. Usually this is not necessary. If the user runs a lot of D weight or throttle boost, greater than normal smoothing can make the motor traces smoother. Unfortunately this smoothing will add latency, delay, and diminish the feed forward effect, which isn't a good thing. Usually it is better to accept some degree of noise in the motor signal and keep using the defaults. If SBus data is at 9ms intervals, the automatic settings are at 50Hz. The lowest I would recommend overriding to, when attempting to reduce RC ripple, would be 30Hz.

If the number of channels is set to a number between 8 and 16, for example, 11, data will be received at 9ms intervals on 13 channels, and 18ms intervals on 3.

Objective: To control an external PWM controlled device (Matek 5-in-1 PDB buzzer), with SPRacing F3, using IO_1[4] (RC CH2) with AUX2 switch. This can be accomplished by one of two ways: A. (Available for all v3.1) Use SERVO_TILT and assign AUX channel of your choice to servo 0 on the Servo tab. B. (Limited to v3.1.5 and later) Use CHANNEL_FORWARDING and set CLI variable channel_forwarding_start to your switch channel number. Option A is recommended if gimbal servo is not used and number of devices are less than or equal to two (SERVO_TILT can only control two channels). Here's step by step for option A, controlling IO_1[4] (RC CH2) with AUX2: (1) BF3.1 does not configure any servo for you; you have to assign it explicitly. (1-1) Make sure you are not using PPM input (CH2 shares a timer with PPM). (1-2) Use following CLI command resource pwm 2 none resource servo 1 a1 save  (2) Turn on SERVO_TILT(And turn off CHANNEL_FORWARDING if you have it on.) (3) On Servo tab, check A2 on servo 0. Resource command above specified servo 1, but this number is 1-origin, servo tab servos are 0-origin, so these are the same. (4) At this point, you should be able to confirm servo 0 on Motor tab responding to AUX2 switch inputs.

Now you must assign your servo in cli: If you type 'resource' in the CLI, you will see that motor 8 are on A03, but Serial_Rx 2 are also on A03 What I did is: Resource motor 8 None Resource Serial_Rx 2 None Resource servo 1 A03  And my servo are working, I did not have to change directions on servo or epa etc. I'm no pro and still don't know what Serial_Rx 2 are doing, but everything is working correctly in the last 2 flights. I have a taranis with a x4r on Sbus and smartport - pids are showing on my taranis as well as battery voltage - seems like I don't use Serial_Rx 2. I halved the P and I 50% from stock on yaw, but the tail were loose, went back to stock and it`s rock solid with no oscillation.  Example 5: Setup for Matek F411 mini for Tricopter in Betaflight 3.2.2 by Flashted​ If Firmware update is needed on F411, it is best done in the CLI. I have found these instructions work with the Betaflight 3.2.2, Something has changed in the higher versions that have made changes to how the tail servo outputs, and this method does not work with Betaflight 3.4.1, or higher. I have not tried between version 3.2.2 - 3.4.0 either. I am at the moment trying to figure out what has changed, and why, but, if you want to try with higher versions, try it, and try to figure it out. Betaflight 3.2.2 works with a minimum of effort to get your craft flying. In the future, I want to experiment with GPS rescue for tricopter, which Betaflight 3.2.2 does not support, so I am going to go foward to version 3.4.1 which supports GPS rescue, and start there. If you power down the board, press the bootloader button on the Matek F411 flight controller, and plug back in like a lot of other boards, it does not enter bootloader mode, and there is NO blinking led confirming bootloader mode, at least with my windows 10 laptop. It does not work. If computer can't detect it, reinstall DFU drivers with zadig or use this https://impulserc.blob.core.windows.net/utilities/ImpulseRC_Driver_Fixer.exe To enter bootloader mode in CLI: In CLI Type bl enter Then bootloader mode is enabled, and newer firmware can be flashed. Do a full CLI dump, to have a reference to the original file before making ANY changes. You may need a fixed starting point in case you have to start over. You must assign it to be a tricopter &quot;first&quot;, and then &quot;save and reboot&quot; it as a tricopter so that all resources, and their designations will show up in the CLI. Setup: The first servo output channel is used for tail servo The first motor output channel is used for tail motor The second motor output channel is used for right motor The third motor output channel is used for left motor. The 2 front motors face forward and (tail) rear motor / servo facing towards you. On the board: Motor 1 - (rear) to motor output pin S1 Motor 2 (right) to motor output pin S2 Motor 3 (left) to motor output pin S3 Motor 4 motor output pin S4 is free, as this is a Tricopter. Motor pin 4 will not work for tail servo due to timing issue. (Tail servo setup is explained below, keep reading) If you need more outputs for servos, or as I needed strobes, motor 4 (S4) can't be remapped to servo if motor 3 (S3) is assigned to a motor. If S5 is used for a servo, S6 can be remapped to a servo also. I used S5 for telemetry in Taranis. You can also use RSSI pad or LED pads for servo outputs. I chose to try to disable motor 4, and noticed that I lost motor 2 when I tried to calibrate the esc's due to some Betaflight strangeness. I re-asigned motor 4 back to the original assignment, and motor 2 worked again, no problems. Go figure... In the BetaFlight GUI in the Receiver Tab is a selection for how the connection to the model is setup. Betaflight Defaults to AETR1234 Aileron, Elevator, Throttle, Rudder(yaw) Aux 1 2 3 4. This is an accepted standard setup on Taranis. In the Configuration tab: feature SERVO_TILT feature CHANNEL_FOWARDING Need to be OFF. Selecting TRICOPTER sets yaw output to servo automaticly. How to set the tail servo: I chose to use pin 6 in my setup for tail servo, as pin 5 in my setup is used for telemetry, as I stated earlier. In the CLI: Type resource motor 6 none save Then the pin will be free. Pin on board is S6, and B10 is the location of the pin. Type: resource servo 1 B10. save Nothing needs to be changed in the Servos tab for movement. Do not draw power from the board with a servo especially on a tricopter. Positive, black negative are going to a pdb 5v output. The yellow or white wire, signal wire can be connected to motor pin 5, motor pin 6, 7 or 8, will work. IF you want to disable the tail servo when it`s not armed, go to the CLI. Type: set tri_unarmed_servo = OFF save Or if you want it on. Type: set tri_unarmed_servo = ON save Now check if your servo/motor are tilting in the correct direction. If you move your yaw stick to the left, the motor must tilt to the right. If not, there are 2 ways to fix this. In CLI: Type Set yaw_control_direction = -1 save If you quickly move your tail to the right the motor must tilt quickly to the left, and vice versa. You can just reverse the yaw direction on your Tx, but it is better to do it in the GUI, so the flight controller does not have to process the data. Set the endpoints in the GUI so you have 40 degrees deflection in both directions, and neutral at as level as you can get it. An analog servo works as will a digital one in most cases my directions were not reversed with an analog servo, but may be with a digital. Hopes this helps. Cheers!!!

The MCU pin must be connected to an accessible board pad or through-holeThere may be a free unused MCU pin on your board, but without the pin broken out as an accessible pad or through-hole, you will end up with horrendous work of breaking out MCU pins by micro soldering. The MCU pin must have a timerMCU pins are associated with different functions. Some are capable of working as UART signal pins, some are capable of working as I2C or SPI bus signal pins, and yet some are only capable of driving the pin logic high or low. Servo outputs need the timer function. Pins associated with timer can be found out by executing resource list command and looking for &quot;MOTOR&quot; or &quot;PWM&quot; entries. The timer should not collide with other usesThis rule requires a bit of explanation. An MCU pin associated with timer is connected to a timer channel of the timer. Each timer has it's own time base (or clock), and all timer channels on the same timer behaves according to the time base. Think, for example, a group of people looking at a (physical) clock with only one hand. Each is given a task of yelling out loud when the second hand advanced certain number of times. If you give them a clock with a hand advancing every second, they will yell based on seconds. Now think of another group of people and give them a clock with a hand that advances once every hour. They will be yelling based on hours. You can NOT mix someone told to yell at every X seconds with someone told to yell at every Y hours in a same group. (To continue...)

Basically you need to map the right servos to the pins used by motors 3 and 4 (on a wing) using the CLI Resource. Use the servos tab to reverse them if needed. Set the PWM frequency as separate from PID loop and set it to 50hz to make the servos work (you will lose all of the new ESC protocols but that's not as important on a plane). The modes and mixes work fine for me as-is and I expect that everything else will be fine as well(like OSD). I just need to add FPV to it and get it up in the air!

It was clearly not intended to work. What I wanted to do was use the resource command to put servos 1-4 on motor outputs 1-4 on my naze board and do a custom smix to assign stabilized roll, stabilized elevator, rc throttle, and stabilized rudder to the outputs respectively. Like a futaba radio. It sounds simple but for the life of me couldn't get it to work last night. I think something is broken somewhere, these possibilities haven't been tested I would think, seeing as betaflight is designed for acro-quad flying it really only gets tested on acro-quads. I think the key is the smix command, either it isn't working correctly or I don't understand it well enough to work. I'll try again when I have more time and see if I can't get this working. so to output stabilized roll to servo 1 I believe the smix command is, if you just reset the smix: smix 0 0 0 100 0 0 100 0, or something like that. rule 0, servo 0 (1), source 0 (PID roll), 100 (rate), 0 (null speed), 0 (min), 100 (max), 0 (box. don't know what this is). As I said I will try again. I already tried iNav but without the resource command I can't map servo 1 to motor output 1, or don't understand how that would work at least. Part 2: OK! I'd like to update that I have the outputs on my Naze32 working for stabilized roll, pitch, and yaw, good for a typical 3 servo 4 channel plane. I am using a 1k cycle and pid loop time. I wanted to use motor output 4, resource b07, as rudder, but it seems broken on my Naze so I moved that to 3 and decided to just use the throttle output on my receiver instead. It's interesting to watch the PIDs wind-up with throttle applied. They wind up up much harder for setpoint changes and hardly at all for board movements. This should make for some interesting flight characteristics. I'm excited to get this on the Crack Laser and in the air to see how it changes the way it flies. It will be funny to be doing a rolling loop and let go of the aileron and have iterm windup keep it rolling another 3 revs or so, lol. I'm more interested in the applications of level mode. For people new to airplanes or for strangers who ask if they can fly, having a working level mode means hey why not. On small 3d foamies at least, what is usually a touchy aerobatic machine could be turned into what amounts to a 3 channel trainer with level mode working. I'll update again after I get it installed in the plane, reversing figured out, and a testflight in. Here is a screenshot of my smix:https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2464844-Betaflight-Flight-Controller-Firmware-Discussion-Thread/page3040#post36958637 smix 0 2 0 100 0 0 100 0 smix 1 3 1 100 0 0 100 0 smix 2 4 2 100 0 0 100 0 smix 3 5 7 100 0 0 100 0 Part 3: Well the thing about it continuing a roll for three revs after you finish a rolling maneuver is true, lol. I've set the I-terms to 0. My original understanding was that there is I term decay and I term gradually becomes less and less effective as it wound up and built up error would be forgiven after a while. Will try to tune some more. I did put the gyro on a perfectly flying plane, might be impossible to make it any better. Part 4: Well I've come to the conclusion that airplanes just don't need gyro stabilization, I'll keep playing with it, because it's interesting, the plane does fly. So far the only neat thing it has accomplished are hard stops for point rolls. I have D at 3 right now and it still has too much of a dampening effect, As you approach your desired rate it steps in and backs off the rate for you. Putting D at 0 and upping rates a little. After turning up the rates and getting rid of D it's starting to make sense. Going to lower my P on ailerons and introduce D back in there and see where it's at. Flies kind of weird, I guess we'll see if it works out. Part 4: It is interesting to fly. I think the application is better suited to something that is less impacted by the extra 7 grams or so a Naze32 adds. It really isn't awful but you can tell it is carrying more weight. The plane I have it on is a Twisted Hobbies Crack Laser. It's an EPP plane for 3D aerobatics that has an AUW of 160-170g or so. I've been flying 3d foamies for many years now and it's the only thing that I'm pretty good at. Auto level works, I need to tune it in better though. With an airplane, especially a flat wing foamie like this one, the elevator doesn't control pitch proportional to servo travel. So it needs some tuning. It works really well for the roll axis, but it doesn't have enough authority on the pitch axis. I have to hold the stick full back to get it to nose up enough to fly, with 45 degree angle limits in place. The strength parameter of angle mode might need to have pitch and roll decoupled for this to work really well for airplanes. The weather took a turn here so it may be a few days or more before I can really mess with the settings and see if I can get it working well. I need to experiment with the D-term and the D setpoint weight. The most interesting application of this is getting roll hesitations to be unnaturally crisp. Realistically using a gyro on a plane like this is more pain than gain, but it's fun to experiment. I think the best application for these boards are quads and hopefully some experimenting will be done and helicopters will work too. The smix I'm using looks like this:# smixsmix 0 2 0 100 0 0 100 0 /pairs PID roll with motor out 1/smix 1 3 1 100 0 0 100 0 /pairs PID pitch with motor out 2/smix 2 4 2 100 0 0 100 0 /pairs PID yaw with motor out 3/smix 3 5 7 100 0 0 100 0 /Attempt to pair RC Throttle to motor out 4/ The smix is for single servo ailerons, elevator, and rudder. It's meant to run 3 servos off the first 4 outputs and an esc off the 4th. For my Naze, maybe it's the board or the code, but I can't get anything to output of motor out 4. I ended up hooking the throttle directly to the receiver and that's fine. But for dual aileron applications you'll want to use motor out 4 for another aileron. Or for when you need other things to work. To understand what all the parameters of smix do, you can google cleanflight smix and it is explained well. I think for flying wing smix there are video tutorials of people setting this up. My resource setup looks like this:# resourceresource SERVO 1 A08resource SERVO 2 A11resource SERVO 3 B06resource SERVO 4 B07These are the resources used by motors 1-4 typically. Interestingly, as identified in the GUI under the servos tab and in the smix commands, as you may have noticed, all the servo labels in the resource command are -1 in value compared to the values used in smix and in the servos tab. So that is one bug that could be fixed. You must use an index between 1 and 8 when resourcing a servo. I tried to resource servo 0 and servo -1 to compensate for the strangeness and it doesn't let you. These resources are also only applicable to the Naze32 I'm pretty sure. Other boards are likely to have a different IO and to determine where to assign the servos can be done with the resource command. You will be able to see where motors 1-4 are resourced and just swap in the servos to these places. ISSUES: I've been having issues with the BF CLI by the way. Sometimes I get garbage characters in the top of the display and other weird things happen sometimes. I flashed cleanflight to my Naze and in the cleanflight CLI it's all pretty and straight. Not that betaflight doesn't work, but it looks a little weird, thought I'd say something. The smix only seems to work on mixer customairplane. When I use mixer custom I can't get the servos to work. As mentioned only the first three motor outs do anything, the fourth I couldn't get to work. The last two MAY work, I don't have pins soldered on the board right now.... I'm not aware of a servo update frequency parameter but having one could be good for airplanes. Those with digital servos can use 200-300hz update frequencies. For future helicopter applications I know that some tail servos have a smaller centerpulse, sort of half way between oneshot and PWM. I think that's everything I learned so far regarding betaflight and planes. Post by: touchthebitum​ Not a great video (first test in LOS flight) but it is only to illustrate that Betaflight can work pretty good with a fixed wing. I'm impressed of the landing speed in acc mode. It was very windy (about 20kmh)https://youtu.be/DpmqeoRGwgA  Betaflight-compatible FC on an EPP Foam Plane by etheli​ I wanted to add a Betaflight-compatible flight controller to a 28&quot; EPP foam plane to get support for OSD, FrSky SBUS receiver, easy VTX frequency configuration, and stabilized flight modes. It took a bit of research and tweaking to come up with a good Betaflight configuration for airplane use. The configuration I came up with lays out on the F3 Omnibus board like this:  Using Betaflight v3.3.3, I started with a CUSTOMAIRPLANE model/mix type. The resources are allocated as follows: resource MOTOR 1 B08 # motor PWM1 &lt;- Throttleresource SERVO 1 A02 # motor PWM4 &lt;- Elevatorresource SERVO 2 A03 # motor PWM3 &lt;- Aileronresource SERVO 3 B07 # motor PWM7 &lt;- Aileron2resource SERVO 4 B06 # motor PWM8 &lt;- Rudderresource SERVO 5 B04 # SBUS/PPM &lt;- Camera tilt [AUX2 (ch6)]resource SERVO 6 A08 # ledstrip &lt;- AUX3 (ch7) # Rule Servo Source Rate Speed Min Max Boxsmix 0 2 1 100 0 0 100 0 # Servo 1 Elevator &lt;- Stabilized pitchsmix 1 3 0 100 0 0 100 0 # Servo 2 Aileron &lt;- Stabilized rollsmix 2 4 0 100 0 0 100 0 # Servo 3 Aileron2 &lt;- Stabilized rollsmix 3 5 2 100 0 0 100 0 # Servo 4 Rudder &lt;- Stabilized yawsmix 4 6 9 100 0 0 100 0 # Servo 5 &lt;- RC AUX2 (ch6)smix 5 7 10 100 0 0 100 0 # Servo 6 &lt;- RC AUX3 (ch7) Because of internal-processor-timer constraints the PWM2 output cannot run a servo (only a motor). Any needed servo reversing should be done in the flight controller (not in the transmitter). The servo-reversing commands look like this: smix reverse 2 1 r # reverse Servo 1 Elevatorsmix reverse 3 0 r # reverse Servo 2 Aileronsmix reverse 4 0 r # reverse Servo 3 Aileron2smix reverse 5 2 r # reverse Servo 4 Ruddersmix reverse 6 9 r # reverse Servo 5 RC AUX2 (ch6)smix reverse 7 10 r # reverse Servo 6 RC AUX3 (ch7) In my setup I needed to reverse the Elevator and Rudder servos. See here for a file containing the basic configuration. The plane flies great in gyro-stabilized (acro) mode. For tuning I needed to lower most of the values to tame oscillations, and I increased the servo 'rate' values to increase the responsiveness of the controls: set p_pitch = 40set i_pitch = 40set d_pitch = 25set p_roll = 25set i_roll = 25set d_roll = 15set p_yaw = 50set i_yaw = 30set roll_srate = 100set pitch_srate = 80set yaw_srate = 80 For the self-leveling flight mode to work well, the plane should be in a somewhat pitch-up position when the accelerometer is calibrated in Betaflight. The calibration can also be trimmed up in that direction. I've posted a full build article for this plane here.  Betaflight for a Flying Delta Wing (using a Betaflight F3) by DangerFlite​ I've been reading the above text and following the thread on rcgroups trying to get a simple rate mode working on my delta wing using a Betaflight F3. I ran into problems because: I'm not using a Naze32, so the aforementioned resource assignments don't applyI'm only using two elevons, so the mixes applied above don't work for meBetaflight is confusing when it comes to servos (everywhere in betaflight it appears to be servo 3 / 4 for the elevons but when you assign resources, they are referred to as servo 1 / 2)It is a lot easier than it looks. The purpose of this guide is to help someone who doesn't already know So far I have the flight controller working great in passthrough mode (manual flight), Acro/rate mode (stabilised), and Angle mode (self-level). Even in passthrough mode the BFF3 is still useful as it enabled the use of an SBUS receiver, telemetry, battery monitoring, and an excellent OSD.

The below configuration fixed the issue. You might be fine to leave these at MULTISHOT125 or one of the DSHOT settings depending on what your ESC supports. It must be something to do with timers. The servos worked regardless of the ESC protocol selected. Configuration tab &gt; Set ESC/Motor protocol to &quot;PWM&quot;†Configuration tab &gt; Enabled &quot;Motor PWM Separated from PID Speed&quot;†Configuration tab &gt; Set &quot;Motor PWM Frequency&quot; to 480hz† All of the PID loop / gyro update frequency combinations I tried yielded the same results. I had to raise pitch/roll P significantly and almost completely disable the I term to get the wing feeling responsive (and not overshoot the angles a lot). D remained basically where it was. Great having the OSD to configure this in the field!

Ideal hardware damping results in a physical effect comparable to that of an electronic low pass filter. We want is full transmission without delay of frequencies below a cut point, and attenuation above that; the higher we go in frequency above the cut point, the less gets transmitted through the damping material. Real world hardware damping usually has the unfortunate result of also generating a resonant peak at the frequency where the damping ought to start. At frequencies above that resonant peak, there is a progressive cut. In principle, therefore, there is no 'maximal damping frequency'. There is just a cutoff point above which damping / attenuation gets progressively greater. The classical physical 'damper' is the shock absorber on a car. Electronic low pass filters (eg PT1 or biquad) do not resonate around cutoff. But most real world hardware damping methods do. The typical damping method we use involves some soft, vibration absorbent material that has a bit of 'give', isolating one part of the system from another. The ideal damping material is a viscoelastic substance that absorbs high frequencies and does not act like a spring. Real world damping materials all act like springs. The springier they are, the more resonance you will get. Adding mass to an object on a spring will lower the cut / resonant peak frequency but will also increase the magnitude of the resonance. For a flight controller, we want to reduce transmission of high frequency noise, but not cause resonance around the peak. The isolating materials should be viscoelastic, not springy. 'Hard' rubber foam and silicone are not viscoelastic. They will minimize transmission of noise but will result in a resonant peak. Adding mass to the FC will lower the cut point and attenuate noise. Very light FC's on relatively hard foam will not be damped much and may resonate at exactly the point we want to cut. If an arm has flex, it will have a resonant peak at a certain frequency and dampen out noise above that. Adding mass to the end of the arm eg with heavier motors will lower that frequency and enhance resonance. Making the arm stiffer will shift the resonant peak higher and attenuate the magnitude of the resonance. The two main problems with 'soft mounting' methods are: they all can induce resonance at or around their cutoff point, and it is difficult to know what the actual cutoff point will be. It is possible to test performance of soft mounting systems is to push noise through them and see how much gets through. For an FC we have the recorder built in - the gyro. So if we were to hard attach the FC to a loudspeaker cone, and drive noise into the loudspeaker, we could get the frequency response of that system (the loudspeaker itself would be non-linear especially with the mass of the FC attached). If we put a soft mount between the loudspeaker cone and the FC, we could see exactly how that soft mount altered noise transmission to the FC; we would have scientific evidence of what kind of attenuation / resonance was actually happening. To do it properly, the mass of the soft mount parts would be included in the first part of the test by attaching them to the loudspeaker cone but not in the attenuation pathway. I did something like this about 30 years ago when testing frequency response of arterial pressure monitoring systems. It takes quite a bit of time to do. Until someone gets hard data on it, we really have no idea if our soft mounts are too soft, too hard, causing resonance, etc. "},{"title":"Soft Mounting the FC board​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Soft Mounting and Noise Reduction","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Soft-Mounting-and-Noise-Reduction#soft-mounting-the-fc-board","content":"A nice Over view of the Yaw Twitch and/or throttle oscillations from ctzsnooze​ Lots of us have seen exactly this behaviour. I am surprised that you seem so astonished now that you find it happens to you. It happens randomly. It could happen to anyone. It just happened to happen to you. :-) It goes away with replacing the gyro chip, replacing the FC, or soft mounting the FC; these fixes work whether or not capacitors are added. Sometimes it goes away by just adding capacitors. Since soft mounting is a reliable fix, external vibration seems the likely culprit, difficult otherwise to explain how soft mounting often causes it to just disappear. Blheli-s ESCs are more commonly implicated than non-BLHeli-s ESC's and in some cases capacitors help so there may be an electrical contribution. It is far more common on yaw than the other axes. The yaw sensor within the chip must be physically different from pitch/roll since the axes relative to the layer of silicon for yaw vs pitch/roll are quite different. That's all we know for sure. How these factors actually cause the oscillation, and why it is yaw exclusive, is completely speculative. When soft mounting doesn't work it's usually because it isn't done in such a way as to effectively isolate the FC. I've seen such extreme examples as to render the quad un-flyable, and also much milder examples, so it is not an all or none thing. Although the magnitude is increased by higher yaw P it is not simple feedback oscillation, there is no threshold value of P below which it disappears. The actual oscillation frequencies are so low as to not be attenuated by the o-rings. Exactly what the o-rings block is not clear. It cannot be eliminated by filtering the gyro data - as has been pointed out before, out the primary oscillation frequency is within the range we need for to fly the quad normally. It is not a software issue in blheli or Betaflight, we can be sure of that. Replacing the gyro chip doesn't change that software yet it does fix the problem. My gut feeling is that this is an inherent issue in these gyro chip themselves, and that some individual examples of these chips get it much worse than others. That's why I recommend replacing the gyro chip or the whole FC if simple soft mounting fails to solve the problem. When you guys say you are soft mounting, be aware you need to over drill the holes to 4mm and ideally bevel the top and bottom of the hole so that the FC 'floats' in all axes. You need to check for free movement. If you don't drill out the holes the bolt holes will stick on yaw on the bolts and transmit vibrations directly. Also you can't have anything stiff pushing on the FC, ideally all wires to/from it need to be very fine silicone. You should revisit that mounting and check it does work like you can freely wiggle the board in all three movements. Do that before doing anything else. That is the most likely thing to fix it. I have seen this problem twice (two separate quads, both 6000's, out of maybe 15 machines) and exhaustively tested solutions on those two with the problem. It is pointless trying to filter it out. It is a hardware gyro issue where it is sensitive to noise generated by motors powered by BLHeli-s ESCs. It will be affected by changing yaw P but typically not eliminated. In both cases, proper soft mounting fixed it. Without the soft mounting I also could eliminate it on one by desoldering the gyro chip and replacing it with a brand new one. I didn't try that on the other. My conceptual model is that the hardware PWM system in BLHeli-S ESCs causes some kind of very specific noise at certain throttle points that deeply affects the yaw sensor part of some gyro chips. It is also possible that there is an issue in BLHeli-S code that causes the problem. By that I mean there may be a throttle point where output is not linear. I have noticed that by spooling motors in motors tab very slowly and listening carefully there are some throttle points where the motors lose their smoothness. This non smoothness at certain points is also the case on non BLHeli-s ESCs. It could be that all four motors together at these points somehow encourage positive feedback. To rule this out someone needs to thrust test in such a way to validate linear proportional motor output in the affected range. But to date no-one has done that test or identified any specific ESC firmware issue. FWIW, I disable all dithering in BLHeli-S. Maybe give that a try. But the most important thing is a truly functional soft mounting. Not some half-hearted bunch of o rings​ MotoLab Cyclone boards have plenty of space around the holes, intentionally, no problem there. It's a totally different situation with a Dodo, which has components very close to the holes. Especially tough if the FC bolts need to keep going up for structural reasons like on many small frames, in which case you have no option but to enlarge the holes. I can't stress enough that just over drilling isn't enough. The board can and will slide on the o ring until one hole stops with the edge of that hole wedged on a bolt. Beveling the top and bottom of the hole allows re-centering and is essential with a yaw issue of his kind. I use a cheap conical grinding stone to make the bevel. Post by jubifly​ Had similar problems on my build. I tried both, limiting possible electrical noise with capacitors and mechanical vibrations by soft mounting the FC with some rubber o-rings. Both with no luck. I then tried to remove the FC completely from fixed parts at the frame and left it hanging in the air (just the motor and rx wires) and the yaw twitches disappeared. My thoughts on that were that the rubber rings were not applicable (maybe too hard?!) for soft mounting... Maybe try leave the FC dangling in the air and see if it still happens - just to definitely eliminate the possibility of mechanical noise being the issue.

Yet for some reason most folks in this hobby are so laser focused on a software-based filter or FC enhancement of some sort they're blinded to what should be an obvious solution. Dampening the motor vibration, stiffening the frame, or even placing a sensor near or on the motors (utilizing the active feedback signal within the FC software for an automated/enhanced filter) are going to have a much more pronounced effect on noise reduction than all the software filtering in the world. I'd also just like to mention that I am in no way trying to imply that software-based filters in the flight controller are ineffective. Only that reducing motor vibration has great and untapped potential in my opinion. AILERON8:​ The same goes for motor soft mounting, the bolts must be isolated for the method to reach its full potential. I have yet to see a quad with fully soft-mounted motors, but I suspect it would make for the smoothest, most oscillation-free quad ever. So oscillation-free these 32khz gyro's should be all set for takeoff. Floating motors should eliminate the opportunity for resonance to develop and propagate towards the sensitive gyros. Unlike soft-mounting the FC, for motor dampening to be effective it doesn't need to eliminate frame oscillation. The goal for motor dampening is to decouple the frames' natural resonant frequency from the motor as its oscillations vary in frequency and amplitude. All motors oscillate, regardless of balancing. The frame won't oscillate if it's detached from the motors. The motor must completely float in order to achieve this effect however. Which is why I think folks will be in for a surprise when they see how well motor soft mounting can be if fully implemented. I honestly think FC soft mounting will be a thing of the past when the results start pouring-in... Using these wiggly jiggly ones from BG:  Tesseract1984:​ Agreed. Having tried it all (soft mount FC, caps on mains, caps on ESCs, soft mounting motors), this seems to be the ticket. I've had varying levels of success with each option. The most useless of them all being a cap on the mains. Soft-mounting motors makes the most sense. In my opinion doing it to the FC is a band-aid while doing the motors attacks the source and doesn't introduce any delay. A little anecdotal story; i once went overboard with soft mounting a LUX v1 and it actually caused problems. I not only had those rubber bobbins, but also O-rings and the lower standoffs resting on a tpu printed plate with screw holes. What this caused was a very slow wobbling oscillation akin to when I-term is too high (at least in older BetaFlight versions). While multi-rotor flight is still in it's infancy and we are trying new things, yes there are a lot of hype trains. As you can see I've been on them all, but truly, this is the first one that has conclusively solved a plethora of issues including: FPV video interferenceHD cam jelloSporadic yaw twitchUn-tuneable D-termetc etc Would love to see frames come out that have motor soft mounting built into the frame. IMO this should become an industry standard. Also had an idea a few months ago for FC screw holes to have silicon material with a hole big enough for screws. Anyway, just my 2 cents. Just converted my whole fleet using tpu soft mounts and it has literally changed my quadcopter experience. My HD footage actually starting to look like I might know what I'm doing. All aboard, the hype train is leaving the station!

I really doubted it would be as effective as it was since vibes can still come thru the mounting screws but it fixed the issue. "},{"title":"Motor Vibration Isolators.

Sometimes shifting the noise upward, but often eliminating it altogether. In addition to trying-out the dynamic notch filter on two quads I spent last weekend playing with my motor softmounts. Empirical testing only, e.g., quads with busted BB's at the moment unfortunately. I also noticed how the higher sounding prop resonance from one of my quads didn't change (as much) with motor soft mounting. My FC soft mounts seemed to be more effective at alleviating the mid-to-high frequencies of the singing unbalanced butter cutters I was testing. It was far from an exhaustive design of experiment, but there was definitely a trend where my silicone and/or rubber soft mounts helped to get rid of the lower motor and frame resonance without having to place additional BF filters. Using the same butters I also noticed how removing my gyro notches had a noticeable impact on mid throttle oscillation reduction as it related to the noisy props. At least on the one quad I was testing, and that's not the first time I've experienced this effect. I'm hoping to do more testing this upcoming weekend and finally get some BB logs to show cause &amp; effect.

The bind pin automatically defaults to RX pin of the UART port the satellite receiver is configured; if you configure UARTx for serial RX and set serial RX protocol to one of SPEKTRUM kind, then UARTx_RX will be used for binding. If SRXL is selected as a serial RX protocol, then UARTx_TX will be used for binding.

NOTE 4: Transient throttle limit should be disabled while using Dynamic Idle (set transient_throttle_limit = 0) "},{"title":"How does Dynamic Idle work?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Tuning Dynamic Idle","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Tuning-Dynamic-Idle#how-does-dynamic-idle-work","content":"Let's first explain how idle is managed without dynamic idle.​ Without dynamic idle, the lower limit of motor drive, under all conditions, is set by the dshot_idle_value. This defaults to 5.5%. When throttle stick is at zero, the motors always get 5.5% motor drive. The PIDs cannot reduce motor drive below 5.5%, either. Imagine we are in a flat drop, or have done a quick 180 degree reversal from high forward speed. In both these situations, airflow is pushing into the props from below the quad (negative inflow). This can slow them down a lot. They may either turn so slowly that they can't start quickly when needed, or stop spinning completely, or even spin backwards. This can lead to poor handling or total loss of control (motor desync), often most obvious at the end of fast flips or rolls. To avoid these issues, we usually need to set the dshot_idle_value relatively high. Also, because the motors are always getting a relatively high drive signal, even when it isn't really needed, we get a limit on our inverted hang time, the quad can be floaty, and we don't get such strong motor braking as we need when stopping flips and making quick moves, or when chopping throttle. If we want to quickly stop a fast roll move, we need to slow down the driving motors. When we tell them to stop, they are moving quickly forward in the air. They have strongly positive airflow which keeps them spinning faster than they need to be. The PIDs would really like to send zero motor drive to them - maximal braking - but cannot send less than 5.5%, even though they are in no danger of stopping. Because they can't be slowed down as much as they could, our ability to stop the turn is not as good as it could be. Finally, lets consider an inverted drop, with a yaw while inverted. While dropping cleanly, the motors will be at 5.5% motor drive, pushing downwards. Air is flowing into the props as we drop, and likely they are spinning faster than is needed. We would like them to spin more slowly, or resist spinning harder, to improve 'hang time' - but we can't, because DShot idle is a high enough number to prevent desyncs. Additionally, if we try to yaw while inverted, the PIDs can only make the motors go faster than idle, and speeding up the motors while inverted really limits hang time. How does dynamic idle change things?​ With dynamic idle enabled, the PIDs are allowed to send zero drive to the motors, so long as they don't spin too slowly. The actual RPM is continually monitored using Bidirectional DShot telemetry. Idle motor drive is dynamically adjusted to keep the slowest motor above the configured minimum RPM - even if its drive signal is zero. Hence dynamic idle will greatly reduce the chance of a desync, and allow lower overall idle settings. Because the motors won't slow down as much under strong reverse airflow conditions, they can start up quickly. This provides improved zero throttle turn responsiveness, greater stability against cross-axis wobble when stopping a flip quickly, and improved zero throttle stability in flat drops. Under strongly positive inflow conditions, where the motors will be spinning faster than expected, they can now be braked much harder, since the PIDs can send as little as zero drive to slow them down, instead of the mandatory 5.5%. This is beneficial when quickly stopping a fast flip or roll, or when performing tricks during inverted drops. These are the three key elements to dynamic idle for 4.2, but only the first two are relevant in 4.3: We get the actual motor RPM via bidirectional DShot telemetry, and use this to prevent any motor falling below the set dyn_idle_min_rpm value. We allow the PIDs to send motor drive to zero, provided that RPM is OK In 4.2, the dshot_idle_value becomes our minimum throttle value. In 4.3, the dshot_idle_value is ignored.

In Betaflight 4.3, that's all you need to do. 4.3 users should follow the instructions in the 4.3 tuning guide, and not the instructions below. In 4.2, the Dynamic Idle control code was not so effective, and the following (complicated) setup procedure was recommended: Take props off !!Set your normal Dshot Idle value in the configuration page of the configuratorGo to the motors tabRe-check that you really did take props off !! :-)Connect a Lipo at around 3.8 - 3.9VEnable the motorsUse the master slider to adjust motor drive; for example, if your Dshot Idle value is 5%, set the motor drive to 1050read the RPM you get at this idle.set your dynamic idle minimum RPM value to something a bit below the idle RPM. Note that 20 means 2000 RPM. For example, if the idle RPM at 1050 was say 2,000, take two zeros off to get 20, then take off 20% to get 16; set your dynamic idle minimum (dyn_idle_min_rpm in CLI) to 16. This setting method puts a kind of throttle up value of 5.5% above a minimum rpm which acts as a lower 'back-stop'. If you already are running a known good DShot idle value, start off with that, and set the dyn_idle_min_rpm value set 20% lower as described above. "},{"title":"Tuning​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Tuning Dynamic Idle","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Tuning-Dynamic-Idle#tuning","content":"Most of the benefits of dynamic idle happen 'out of the box' as soon as dynamic idle is enabled at the correct rpm value. Turn responsiveness, drop stability, and desync reduction should improve immediately. Higher minimum RPM values - 30-40 - with lower DShot Idle percent values will keep the motors spinning more quickly when the throttle is cut, or in strongly positive inflow states. This will lead to more rapid spool up when needed, better zero throttle stability, and crisper flips - at the cost of less effective braking and a more 'floaty' feel, and reduced inverted hang time. Lower idle values (both reduced together) will lead to improved inverted hang time, at the cost of greater risk of de-sync, reduced stability when chopping throttle hard after a punch, when blipping up from idle, and any time you are at idle, eg mid-flip, flat drops, etc. Because the motors will idle more slowly, they may have difficulty re-starting after being commanded to idle, eg at the end of a flip, causing instability and bounce back. Every quad is different, and the purpose we put them to varies a great deal. Unless your requirements or build are unusual, the default idle value is usually quite good. Low authority quads (larger props, weaker motors, ducted cine quads, endurance quads) will typically do better with higher idle values. High authority quads often fly best with idle values around 4-4.5%. I'm after lots of inverted hang time in 4.2​ To get longer inverted hang time, go for the lowest possible values of both DShot idle percentage and dyn_idle_min_rpm. Keep dyn_idle_min_rpm adjusted relative to DShot as described above (20% lower than the idle rpm). REMEMBER: both values must be reduced! You can go as low as you like, eventually you will get annoying instability with throttle chops, or desyncs. If you were running DShot idle of 5% and dyn_idle_min_rpm of 20 was 20% below rpm at 5%, you could try DShot idle of 4% and dyn_idle_min_rpm of 16. If that was OK, then 3.5% and 14, even 3% and 12. When hard flip stops or throttle chops get ragged, or you start tumbling out of the sky under reverse airflow due to a desync, that's too low. You can typically get well below the default DShot idle value. Really low idle settings may maximise inverted time but will adversely affect stability as described above. Is this useful for whoops?​ Yes, for sure. 4.3 is better. Whoops have low authority at idle that is often improved significantly with the combination of Thrust Linear and Dynamic Idle. Whoops may require higher than default idle values to keep their motors spinning reliably. I'm a very high turn rate Acro LOS pilot​ When targeting very high maximum turn rates - 1800 deg/s for example - desyncs can be more of a problem than for quads with lower target rates. For maximum acrobatic and hang performance in a high power to weight LOS quad, the goal would be the lowest idle values that didn't cause desyncs or other adverse effects like excessively slow startup after flips. Note that if the rpm from dyn_idle_min_rpm is higher than that of DShot idle, hovers may not be smooth, since the dynamic idle controller may hunt around a little, but desyncs are less likely. I'm a race pilot​ Mostly a high minimum RPM of 3500 - 4000 works best. The DSHot Idle value can be set low, eg 2-3% Racers typically use low throttle very little of the time, so you might wonder why you'd bother with something that only influences idle behaviour. There are two reasons. First, braking. Sure we want to go fast, but we also want to slow down. If we can set idle lower than usual, we can brake harder. Dynamic idle lets us do that. We can go full throttle, and when we cut throttle, we will bleed off speed more quickly, making the next turn easier. We will also be able to drop into dive gates more aggressively on cutting throttle. Second, turn performance high speed. Typically at high speed we have strong positive inflow. We can turn faster with dynamic idle active because under positive inflow conditions it can brake motors down to zero drive, helping turn in more quickly. When flying race courses that involve high speed entries to maneuvers such as split-S or tight hairpins, dynamic idle may allow more consistent 'reverse throw' and improved control/propwash management, allowing more accurate rhythm-based turn entry and vertical maneuvers (e.g. repetitive dive/antigravity gates or inverted dive entries). Optimal dynamic idle for experienced racers, who keep throttle on most of the time, may be with slightly reduced idle values. Something like your DShot idle reduced to say 4 - 4.5%, and dyn_idle_min_rpm 20% below that, maybe. The downside of lower idle values is that if you do make a mistake and do a zero throttle reversal, it may be uglier. "},{"title":"The technical stuff​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Tuning Dynamic Idle","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Tuning-Dynamic-Idle#the-technical-stuff","content":"When we first arm, until Airmode is activated, Dynamic Idle is constrained to a fixed 4% maximum increase in motor drive, for safety reasons. If we have set DShot idle to a very low value, like 1%, we may see a slightly lower, and very stable, RPM before Airmode activates - a value which may be less than our configured minimum RPM. Once Airmode is active, Dynamic Idle becomes fully effective, that is removed, and the RPM should not fall below the target RPM while in flight. Dynamic idle adjustments are not instantaneous. The correction factor uses a special PID controller where the adjustment is proportional to the difference between the needed and actual motor accelerations. Feedback delays have some potential for instability when extreme values are used. The stability of the dynamic idle controller can be tested by hovering with very low dynamic idle. The quad will rely entirely on dynamic idle to maintain stable hover RPM. On unusual builds, it might be unstable so take care. You would do this kind of testing only to check that the dynamic idle system was working well. Usually it is not needed. The secondary settings are best left at defaults. idle_adjustment_speed is a gain multiplier on the crude difference between actual and target rpm. Default is 50. idle_p sets the gain of the controller. Higher values will cause corrections to be more aggressive. These two parameters should not need adjusting in most cases. To confirm that they are appropriate for your quad, enable the RPM debug, fly straight vertically up at speed, cut throttle quickly to zero, and drop straight flat down under zero throttle. If the motor traces and rpm traces are smooth, all is good. If they are wobbling, the values may need to be tweaked a bit. My race quads work very well with idle_p a bit higher, at 80, but increasing idle_adjustment_speed as well made the rpm traces a bit sawtoothed. idle_pid_limit constrains the maximum allowed error correction. If set too low, reverse airflow may still cause a desync because the amount of correction may be inadequate. idle_max_increase is a limit on the maximum allowed percentage increase in idle above zero, expressed as percent *10. Default of 150 means 15% motor drive is the maximum increase that can be applied to prevent a desync. Higher values run the risk of driving the other motors very hard in the event of a prolonged desync. The Dynamic Idle debug returns: 0 : motorRangeMinIncrease * 1000 1 : targetRpsChangeRate (simple RPM error * idle_adjustment_speed) 2 : error (amount of error to fix) 3 : minRps (lowest current motor rpm, in revolutions per second * 10)  So, for example, a minRps value of 500 corresponds to 50.0 * 60 = 3000rpm "},{"title":"Unified Targets for users","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Unified-Targets","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Working on firmware​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Unified Targets for users","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Unified-Targets#working-on-firmware","content":"Save a copy of the unified target to your computer from the repository, lets use MTKS-MATEKF411.config as an example.

Both 8k and 32k gyro modes should fly on defaults, though 32k may require more filtering - always check motor temps after the first flight. Note that 3.4 contains major changes to filtering and several new features that dramatically improve potential flight performance. Do not expect it to fly the same as earlier versions! If motor temps are OK, and handling generally alright, there are several changes that may further improve flight behaviour. If motors are warmer than you'd like, check the section on filters below. Otherwise, the defaults are probably OK for your quad. For optimal flight performance I'd recommend enabling iterm_relax by pasting into the CLI: set iterm_relax = RP  This will enable the term_relax code on pitch and roll. It markedly reduces I bounce-back after flips or rolls, and allows higher levels of I than before. Typically I can be increased by 50% or more, which improves directional stability while flying in turbulent air or when approaching gates at high speed. I'd also recommend using the new filter based rc_smoothing on all axes: set rc_smoothing_type = FILTER set rc_interp = AUTO set rc_interp_ch = RPYT  This removes spikes and sharp edges that otherwise arise during rapid stick inputs. It should keep the motors sounding smooth and running cool during frequent rapid stick inputs, without delaying responsiveness as much as the older interpolation method (which is still available as an alternative). If you enable item_relax, throttle_boost, or use D setpoint weight above zero, you definitely should activate RC smoothing on the relevant axes, as above. IMPORTANT: SBus or FPort users should stop using OpenTX when using 16 channels. IMPORTANT: Spektrum users with certain transmitters (DX6i, DXe, DX6e) should read this document for setting up RC Smoothing Filter correctly. Note that with RC smoothing, the sharp spikes from D weight or throttle inputs will be smoothed out. While this improves efficiency, motor temperature, and smoothness of motor control signals, losing those spikes reduces the effectiveness of D weight, P, and throttle boost, during very rapid stick inputs, a tiny bit. After enabling RC smoothing, if you notice a small reduction in response to rapid stick inputs, consider increasing D weight, throttle boost and, perhaps, P by up to about 20%. Usually this is not required. "},{"title":"The defaults are OK but I want to make some changes.

This is approximately equal to 0.8 in pre-3.4 versions. More D weight means greater immediacy of stick responses, particularly to quick stick movements. If the default of 0.6 doesn't feel responsive enough at the same rates as before, try a higher value. 1.0 is sufficient to overcome the normal damping behaviour that D itself would otherwise slow down responses to your stick inputs - the quad shifts from the measurement mode of D calculation to to error mode. Values above 1.0 provide an additional 'feed forward' effect. Higher D weight can feel excessively twitchy, but can allow reduction in P while retaining the same overall responsiveness. The new default D Setpoint Transition value is zero. If you previously flew with 1.0 or 0.5, to get a smooth centre feel for freestyle, and it now feels too twitchy around centre sticks, use your old setting. The default of 0 provides equal stick responsiveness regardless of stick position, and is recommended for racing. 0.5 is great for freestyle. Values above zero, but under 0.1, are not recommended, because they may cause glitching when the sticks are smoothly swept across the centre position. If your PID settings were higher than the current defaults, and the quad feels like it is a bit less responsive than before, try with values for P, D, and D weight more like what you had, and consider trying 20% above your old defaults.

The default is to have all four low-pass filters active at the same time, the dynamic notch filter on, but no other notch filters active. This provides less filtering delay, typically, than before, but with better filter performance. The two gyro filters clean up noise before the gyro signal enters the PID loop. P, I and D are then derived from that filtered data. The two D filters are applied only to the D signal. To determine the relative contribution of P and D noise to overall motor noise, analyse a blackbox spectrum from PID_P and compare that to a spectrum from PID_D. Typically there will be more D noise than P noise. Hence we usually need filter D more heavily than P. The more filtering we apply, the less noise gets through to the motors, and this keeps them sounding smooth and running cool. If we apply too much filtering, the PID calculations will be delayed, and flight performance will suffer. Without enough filtering, the motors may run hot, especially if the props get bent or the motor bearings are worn, etc. Dual PT1 filters allow fine tuning of the amount of filtering to match the noisiness of the quad. Here are some examples of typical filtering setups, that can be pasted into the CLI: A really good quad with a very solid frame, new motors, and only ever flown with clean well balanced light props: set gyro_lowpass_type = PT1 set gyro_lowpass_hz = 150 set gyro_lowpass2_type = PT1 set gyro_lowpass2_hz = 400 set dterm_lowpass_hz = 100 set dterm_lowpass2_hz = 250  A typical 5&quot; quad with motors/props that aren't new but are average, and bent props aren't a problem: (if MPU6000 gyro is used gyro_lowpass2 can be set to 0 for best performance but logging/hot motors should be used to verify if this ok) set gyro_lowpass_type = PT1 set gyro_lowpass_hz = 120 set gyro_lowpass2_type = PT1 set gyro_lowpass2_hz = 300 set dterm_lowpass_hz = 100 set dterm_lowpass2_hz = 250  A typical quad on a decent frame that needs to tolerate bent props: set gyro_lowpass_type = PT1 set gyro_lowpass_hz = 120 set gyro_lowpass2_type = PT1 set gyro_lowpass2_hz = 300 set dterm_lowpass_hz = 80 set dterm_lowpass2_hz = 160  A beat up quad on a sloppy frame that often is flown with bent props: set gyro_lowpass_type = PT1 set gyro_lowpass_hz = 90 set gyro_lowpass2_type = PT1 set gyro_lowpass2_hz = 180 set dterm_lowpass_hz = 70 set dterm_lowpass2_hz = 140  The higher the filter numbers - meaning, less filtering - and the better the state of the quad, the better it will fly.

Furthermore it is capable of adjusting the filter setpoint automatically to suite the RC command intervals. To activate the filter method, paste and save set rc_smoothing_type = FILTER in the CLI. A biquad filter is then applied to the set incoming RC data, smoothing off the sharp square corners at the default frequency. Sharp steps on throttle, P and D weight are then attenuated. Because D setpoint weight adds even bigger spikes with each RC input, a second filter is applied specifically to D setpoint weight. The end result is a smoother set of motor traces. Each incoming RC step results in an immediate step up in PIDsum and the motors, but the step up is not a sharp spike any more, reducing motor heat accumulation, improving efficiency, and making them sound smoother during rapid stick movements. Spikes also can trigger iterm_windup protection, this code avoids that problem. When set rc_smoothing_input_hz = 0, the code calculates the ideal low-pass value for RC command based on the initial RC interval. The same applies for set rc_smoothing_derivative_hz = 0, which sets the second low-pass value that gets applied to D weight automatically. For 9ms Sbus, the automatic value is 50Hz. The actual values are written into the blackbox log header. If you run very high levels of D weight, a somewhat lower derivative smoothing frequency may smooth out some of the big spikes that you might otherwise see. Some people have voiced concern that low-pass filtering RC inputs will cause delay. While that is true, without any filtering the motors trace gets filled with spikes that appear at each RC input step. The current filter based smoothing code just takes the sharp point off these spikes, and doesn't delay the bulk of the step, or the majority of the D weight effect at all - the step up in the motors trace is still there at exactly the same time, just a bit smoother and rounder. "},{"title":"iTerm Relax​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Tuning Tips for BF 3.4","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Tuning-Tips-for-Betaflight-3.4#iterm-relax","content":"The new iTerm_relax functionality by JoeLucid cuts, or reduces, I accumulation during fast stick inputs. It can be enabled to work on pitch and roll alone, or pitch, roll and yaw. The code has two operational modes, setpoint and gyro. Gyro mode is more clinical and complete in suppressing iTerm, Setpoint mode is a bit smoother with slightly softer landings after flips. Setpoint mode applies a high-pass filter to RC input, resulting in a value that gets higher whenever the sticks are moved quickly. When the rate of change is zero (i.e., the sticks are not moving), iTerm accumulation is normal. Accumulation is then attenuated linearly as the stick movement approaches a threshold. Above threshold, no iTerm accumulation occurs at all. Gyro mode uses a high-pass filter based on rate of change of stick movement, and uses this to create a window either side of the gyro value inside which the quad should be tracking. While inside the window, no iTerm accumulation occurs. If the sticks are held still, the window compresses back to nothing, and iTerm accumulation becomes normal again. Since Gyro bases the amount of iTerm suppression on how well the quad follows the expected path it can adjust the iTerm if that's required to implement the setpoint change demanded by the sticks. This can facilitate better tracking in unbalanced quads or if throttle changes are applied during the move. In both case the filter time constant can be adjusted to fine-tune the response. Typically no adjustment is required. Sometimes after a fast multi-rotation flip, or other fast input, some I may accumulate and hang around too long once the stick movements stop, causing a late settling of turn rate. Typically this will be less of a problem if the frequency is increased. This feature is really useful and is capable, in a quad where P and D are well tuned, of totally eliminating bounce-back due to I. "},{"title":"Throttle Boost​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Tuning Tips for BF 3.4","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Tuning-Tips-for-Betaflight-3.4#throttle-boost","content":"This feature, also by JoeLucid, improves responsiveness to fast throttle inputs. The code uses high-pass filtering on the RC throttle signal to create additional 'kicks' in throttle. It is basically a feed forward factor on throttle. The faster the throttle stick is moved, the greater the boost effect. The result is a quicker, more responsive feel to fast throttle inputs - both on increasing throttle, and cutting throttle. It is particularly useful for quads that are weaker in terms of throttle responsiveness, or for making 3S feel like 4S, or 4S feel like 5S. The height of each 'kick' is determined by the size of the RC step multiplied by the throttle_boost amount, and how long it lasts is set by the throttle_boost_cutoff value. The default throttle_boost_cutoff value is 15Hz, meaning a time constant of 10ms. This works well for SBus 9ms radio setups, with or without rc smoothing on throttle. It results in about 40% residual 'kick' carrying over into the next step, accumulating as the stick movement continues quickly, and dissipating otherwise. The kick is rounded somewhat. If rc_smoothing is enabled on throttle, a higher cutoff frequency can reduce the residual for accumulation, allowing the rc smoothing handles the spikes that would otherwise appear. For example, a value of 25 at 50Hz is about the same as 5 at 15Hz, but with less overshoot tendency. If the throttle_boost value is 0, the effect is disabled. With the default throttle_boost_cutoff of 15, throttle_boost = 5 is enough to overcome most to all RC smoothing delay on throttle (if indeed rc smoothing was applied to throttle). Throttle should feel a bit more responsive - and sound smoother - than un-smoothed throttle input. Increasing boost above 5 at 15Hz results in feed forward on throttle. Values of 10 or higher can be used to overcome excessive motor delay when over-propping weaker motors. Too much throttle boost may cause a kind of over-run and excessive sensitivity to big inputs. This can be attenuated by choosing a higher throttle boost cutoff frequency, e.g. 50Hz, and a corresponding increase in amount, e.g. 25. RC smoothing on throttle then becomes essential. That's because higher cutoff frequency will cause sharper spikes of shorter duration, with less tendency to accumulate. Leaving the default value at 15 is probably a good idea. Better, if a sensitivity adjustment is needed, to change the throttle_boost value.

It is not enabled by default Normally, D setpoint weight is a feed forward amount that increases with quicker RC stick movements. The greater the D weight, the greater the stick sensitivity to pitch and roll. In the classical betaflight PID system, D setpoint weight assists P in initiating turns. Typically D setpoint weight climbs quicker and relatively earlier than P. Adding more D setpoint weight, and reducing P a little, can reduce PID overshoot without losing stick sensitivity. Smart Feed forward changes the D setpoint weight behaviour, such that it replaces P entirely, but only when it is greater than P (and in the same direction). For it to work, the D setpoint value must be set significantly higher than usual - up to 2.0 or more. Then, a large part of the initial part of a turn is driven very hard by D weight, and P doesn't need to do so much. In some settings, this can reduce overshoot a bit.

It's purpose is to address the same attitude issues as iterm_rotation but without some of its downsides. Absolute Control continuously measures the error of the quads path over stick input, properly rotated into the quads coordinate system, and mixes a correction proportional to that error into the setpoint. It's as if you noticed every tiny attitude error the quad incurs and provided an instantaneous correction on your TX. The result is significantly better tracking to sticks, particularly during rotations involving yaw and other difficult situations like throttle blips. Absolute control will likely eventually replace iterm_rotation, but is not yet enabled by default. You should not enable abs_control and iterm_rotation at the same time. To enable: set abs_control_gain = 10. Smaller quads are ok with 5. AbsoluteControl needs to be used with iTermRelax to avoid bounce-backs due to the latency between stick movement and quad response. iTermRelax will then suspend AbsoluteControl error accumulation as well during quick moves. Finally AbsoluteControl only kicks in once the throttle minimum for airmode activation is exceeded to avoid undue corrections on the ground.

For example, if a quadcopter clips a gate, tree, branch or other object and causes a high rate yaw spin, it may go into a 'never-ending' uncontrollable spin. Typically it makes a distinctive warbling noise and climbs rapidly - the so-called Yaw Spin To The Moon (YSTTM) problem. 3.4 introduces two code features that should bring such spins under control more quickly and cleanly. Yaw Spin Recovery is intended primarily for FPV pilots, and works best with MPU gyros. LOS acro pilots who use high yaw rates may prefer to disable this function. "},{"title":"Usage​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Yaw Spin Recovery and Gyro Overflow Detect","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Yaw-Spin-Recovery-and-Gyro-Overflow-Detect#usage","content":"yaw_spin_recovery can be enabled or disabled in the CLI: set yaw_spin_recovery = ON or set yaw_spin_recovery = OFF The 'threshold' value is the spin rate, in degrees per second, at which the spin protection kicks in. The default threshold of 1950 was chosen to minimise false triggering. For FPV, a lower value, e.g. 100-200 above your maximum configured yaw rate, is recommended. For example, a quad with a maximum configured yaw rate of 700 degrees/sec: set yaw_spin_threshold = 850 Too low a threshold may cause false triggering, and delay return to normal control.

One pair of motors goes full on, the others go to minimum rpm. Once the yaw spin rate falls _below threshold by 100 degrees per second, and stays below threshold for 20ms, full control is returned to the pilot. Without this feature active, it is possible for any quad to get indefinite spins when the spin rate confuses the gyro. See &quot;What is the underlying cause&quot; below... "},{"title":"Should I lower the threshold?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Yaw Spin Recovery and Gyro Overflow Detect","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Yaw-Spin-Recovery-and-Gyro-Overflow-Detect#should-i-lower-the-threshold","content":"A threshold of 1000 will reduce the total time spent in a typical out of control yaw spin by about half, compared to a threshold of 1950. For quads configured with a maximum yaw rate of about 800 degrees/sec, a threshold of 1000 works well, and should result in a return to normal control in about a quarter of a second after clipping a gate. False triggering will occur if the quad's yaw rate exceeds the threshold during normal flying. It is very unusual for FPV pilots to exceed 500 degrees/sec in normal racing, even during very quick turns. Exceeding 500 degrees/sec usually only happens if the pilot performs 'tricks' involving sustained commanded yaw spins. Personally, I run 850 and find that works very well for me. My maximum yaw rate is configured to 800 but even if I do a deliberate full yaw spin, I don't see anything suggesting that I hit the limit.

The solution is to reduce the maximum commanded yaw rate, or set the threshold higher.

The safest thing to do is to cut throttle, centre sticks, and mentally prepare for either re-gaining control, or disarming. When yaw spin protection is triggered, the quad gets driven with 50% effective throttle. It will accelerate briefly, perpendicular to the spin axis, but control should be returned to the pilot quickly, and should not climb much. There is no need to increase throttle manually. Control will be returned to the pilot 20ms after the spin rate falls 100 degrees/sec below threshold. Although the quad will still be spinning, the PIDs will become fully active, and will quickly stabilise the quad. By the time the pilot can see which way the quad is pointing, it should be easy to control. If the spin is prolonged, for example more than half a second, there may be a gyro overflow, a badly bent prop or some other hardware problem, and the pilot should disarm. "},{"title":"I have an ICM gyro, will this work with gyro_overflow_detect active?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Yaw Spin Recovery and Gyro Overflow Detect","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Yaw-Spin-Recovery-and-Gyro-Overflow-Detect#i-have-an-icm-gyro-will-this-work-with-gyro_overflow_detect-active","content":"Gyro_overflow_detect is special code intended to deal with overflow issues on ICM gyros. The default is to be on, for all axes. It is unwise to disable this if your quad has an ICM gyro. It is not needed or helpful for MPU gyros. ICM gyros are susceptible to overflow-inversion problems if exposed to very high turn rates. If enabled and set to ALL, overflow protection will kick in and disable all PIDs whenever any axis exceeds 1950 degrees/second. Because the FC then won't know the actual direction of the spin, it slows down all motors to their minimum / idle throttle value, until all axes fall below 1850 degrees per second. This can take a long time, since the quad does not actively oppose the spin. 1850 degrees/second is still a very fast spin. If yaw spin recovery is active at a lower threshold (say 800), recovery to below 800 will be faster and cleaner than otherwise. So the answer is yes, yaw_spin_recovery is useful for ICM gyros even if Gyro_overflow_detect is enabled.

In normal FPV flying and racing, actual yaw rates more than 500 degrees/sec are unusual even in the fastest turns. However, some FPV freestyle pilots like to do fast yaw spins, and may set a maximum yaw spin rate (in the rates part of the configurator) as high as 1000, and actually achieve that sometimes. If, say, the quad was configured for yaw rates of 1000 degrees/second and the yaw spin protection threshold was set at 800, and if the pilot then did a flat yaw spin by holding yaw at 100% with pitch and roll centred... the quad would rotate faster and faster, using one pair of motors to generate the yaw. When the quad hit the yaw spin protection point of 800, the opposite pair of motors would spin maximally, quickly slowing the yaw rate down to 700 degrees/second. This would probably take only 100ms. The quad might climb momentarily and wobble a bit, and for this short time there would be zero pitch and roll authority. This would quickly terminate, and if the higher yaw spin rate was still being commanded, the quad would again speed up to 800 degrees per second. An FPV pilot would see the yaw rate jittering between 700 and 800, there may be some pitch and roll artefacts, and the quad would make a strange noise. If this happens just turn the threshold up a bit. "},{"title":"What does it look like in a blackbox log?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Yaw Spin Recovery and Gyro Overflow Detect","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Yaw-Spin-Recovery-and-Gyro-Overflow-Detect#what-does-it-look-like-in-a-blackbox-log","content":"Here is a real log of clipping the ground during an arcing turn with an MPU gyro. It's only a small impact. Peak yaw rate of about -1800 degrees/sec is attained within 2ms, exceeding the threshold of 800 and initiating yaw_spin_protection. At that point, two motors get 100% drive and the opposing pair 0% drive, resulting in maximum authority to slow the spin. During this time the roll and yaw components passively rotate the quad (it does a kind of axle roll around one arm at the same time). After about 120ms yaw rate drops below 700, then there is a 20ms delay period, and about 140ms after impact, normal PID control is returned to the pilot. The quad still is rolling in excess of 2000 degrees per second but now that the quad is not spinning, the PID system corrects this within about another 140ms. The quad becomes flyable again about ¼ second after impact. Note that if the threshold was set at default value of 1950, the yaw_spin_protection code would not be activated with this impact.  This is a log of a much more significant impact. The peak yaw spin rate probably exceeded 8000 degrees per second, judging by rate of return to normal, and involved bent props. The total time in full yaw_spin_recovery mode (one pair of motors full on) is about 600ms. This is the longest spin yet recorded with yaw spin protection. The vast majority resolve in under 400ms. Note that there is also significant pitch and roll wobble from the impact, as well as yaw spin. The instant of impact there is more than 2000 degrees/sec in pitch and, soon after, more than 2000 deg/sec in roll. If this was an ICM gyro, all PIDs would have been zeroed and there would be no active suppression of these spins - it would most likely take more than 3-4 seconds to passively slow down enough for control to be returned to the pilot, if this was an ICM gyro. This was an MPU6000 gyro, so yaw_spin_protection could actively stop the spin with full motor authority regardless of the magnitude of the spin. During the yaw spin correction period, all pitch and roll wobbles died out without any active PID involvement. By the time the spin had resolved, there was no meaningful pitch and roll problem. Most likely the reasonably rapid passive attenuation of pitch and roll wobble is because of the gyroscopic stabilisation effect of having two motors running full on in opposite directions, and the substantial air resistance in the pitch and roll axis of a quad that is actively suppressing a yaw spin.  With yaw_spin_protection, this massive spin stopped relatively quickly. "},{"title":"What is the underlying cause of these indefinite yaw spins - how does this code work?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Yaw Spin Recovery and Gyro Overflow Detect","url":"/docs/wiki/archive/Yaw-Spin-Recovery-and-Gyro-Overflow-Detect#what-is-the-underlying-cause-of-these-indefinite-yaw-spins---how-does-this-code-work","content":"A spin of this magnitude rotates the frame so fast that motors swap position (move 180 degrees opposite to their previous position) in 40ms or less. This is as fast as a motor can speed up or slow down. The normal PID responses to pitch and roll wobbles will not actually make any difference to motor speed until it has rotated to the opposite location from where it should have been. This means that pitch and roll PID responses in a rapidly rotating spin will feed back positively on themselves, maintaining or worsening the pitch and roll wobbles as long as the quad keeps spinning. Additionally, because the PID system is switching motors on and off randomly to deal with the massive swings in gyro values on pitch and roll, it does not put full authority into suppressing the spin. As a result the spin persists for a very long time. It is possible that at some point the motor speed changes may feed back positively into the spin. This bizarre combination of factors is what causes yaw spin to the moon events on MPU gyros. The key factor is having an extremely high yaw spin component. Very high rate pure pitch spins do not have this problem, nor do high rate axle rolls involving high rates of pitch and roll at the same time. But when pitch and roll is combined with high spin rates, logs show the gyros and PIDs going all over the place on all axes in a chaotic manner. By focusing the quad on actively suppressing the yaw spin component, these kinds of long duration flyways are prevented. That's what this code does.

The firmware is OMNIBUSF4SD target release 3.2, or post-3.1.7 dev builds. TX6 has another inverter in place, but it is not used as an inverter, but an (unstable) uni-directional buffer. The uni-directional nature of the buffer prevents half-duplex (bi-directional) protocol such as SmartPort, SmartAudio and Tramp from working. Inverter Pin Configuration​ V1 and V2 have different inverter configuration. V2's inverter control is PC8, which is different from that of V1, which is PC9. As a matter of fact, PC8 is same as the pin used by OMNIBUS F4 V3. This derives following instruction regarding inverter configuration for RX6, for BF post-3.1.7 (3.2). ASGARD V1​ Use OMNIBUSF4SD target. Since default value for the inverter is PC8, users must explicitly change this to PC9 using the following CLI command. resource inverter 6 c9  ASGARD V2​ Use OMNIBUSF4SD target.

WARNING: If the motors are connected and the board boots into the bootloader, they will start to spin after around 20 seconds, it is recommended not to connect the motors until the board is flashed. Flashing To flash the board: Open Cleanflight ConfiguratorChoose the latest CJMCU firmware from the list.Select &quot;Load Firmware [Online]&quot; and wait for the firmware to download.Tick &quot;No Reboot Sequence&quot; and &quot;Full Chip Erase&quot;Connect the USB-&gt;Serial adapter to the boardSelect the USB-UART adapter from the top left boxClick &quot;Flash Firmware&quot;You should see &quot;Programming: SUCCESSFUL&quot; in the log boxClick &quot;Connect&quot; -&gt; This should open the &quot;Initial Setup&quot; tab and you should see sensor data from the quad shownUnplug the quad and short the 2 &quot;BOOT0&quot; pins. Revision 1 boards require this to be soldered, revision 2 boards can connect the included jumper to the two pre-soldered pins - This prevents the board from going into bootloader mode on next boot, if anything goes wrong, simply disconnect these two pins and the bootloader will start, allowing you to reflash. You cannot overwrite the bootloader. Charging The CJMCU has on it a TP4056 Lithium battery charging IC that can charge a 1S battery at 1A using a provided 5v supply attached to the 5v serial pin.

But just how clean that ESC control signal is when using DSHOT600, is untested. For a discussion on this, see https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?3036325-Racerstar-Crazybee-F3-Ultimate-Micro-AIO-FC%21-1S-5A-BlheliS-Frsky-Flysky-OSD/page3 .The factory default GYRO / PID config is 8KHz / 2KHz . There are reports that this may lead to possible instability and 4KHz / 4KHz is recommended. Specific information for the factory supplied Betaflight 3.3.0 version: The DSHOT beeper function does not work.When turtle mode (&quot;Flip over after Crash&quot;) is activated, the FC will only arm if the failsafe timeout is 1s (10 * 0.1s) or more. If the timeout is set lower than that, you may see the motors shortly try to spin up and then stop, and then the quad will not be armed. Rumour has it that this is fixed in BF 3.4 . FRSKY Version: To bind to your Taranis, you need to be running the non-eu OpenTX version, which allows you to use the required D8 setting to bind to the RX. The factory default BF receiver mode is FRSKY_X, so remember to configure this if needed.FrSky X (8 / 16 channels) and FrSky D (8 channels) work both reliably, including in combination with crash flip / Dshot beacon, as long as the TELEMETRY feature is disabled; Basic telemetry information like RSSI and battery voltage will be sent even when the TELEMETRY feature is disabled;On FrSky D, the TELEMETRY feature causes occasional dropouts, depending on how many sensors (BARO, GPS, ...) are enabled, probably due to a timing overrun;On FrSky X, the TELEMETRY feature causes hard lockups due to a bug in the telemetry generation code.

The Crazyflie 2.0 has an extensive expansion deck system with various decks that plug in to the expansion headers to enable various additional functions like buzzers, LEDs, indoor localization, and even an ESC breakout designed for mounting the board on a larger brushless build. The board has its own operating system and set of client side tools which enable all the functionality of these decks and the copter.

There is an onboard barometer for altitude sensing along with an On Screen Display (OSD) chip directly connected to the main processor (MCU). This tight integration between the MCU and the OSD enables fast updates to the display and easy configuration of the OSD, which is managed straight from the BetaFlight configuration tool. You no longer need to worry about the extra hassle of configuring your OSD with a USB/UART adapter and 3rd party configuration tool, it's all built into the flight control software.

But there are some special XSR receivers, who's input capacitance are higher than the normal, it may cause the smartport waveform distorted. The waveform don't drop to 0v during low period. See the following picture. Change a resistor on the KakuteF4 from 4.53K to 2.2K, the waveform looks good. That may be the reason.  If the SmartPort don't work stable, please try this way. If you don't have a SMD resistor, you can use a 5.1K plug-in resistor to bypass SmartPort signal to GND. It has the same effect. And we have changed this resistor from 4.53K to 2.2K at the secondary produce.

In this case the FC will not be detected by Windows/MacOS. Windows detects the FC as &quot;Unknown Device&quot;, MacOS reports &quot;enumeration errors&quot;. If you see some of these errors unplug all devices from the FC and flash the FC standalone. ###Voltage and Current Scaling: Flying Lemon said to use the following for scale: voltage 57, current 320.

I have found these instructions work with the Betaflight 3.2.2, Something has changed in the higher versions that have made changes to how the tail servo outputs, and this method does not work with Betaflight 3.4.1, or higher. I have not tried between version 3.2.2 - 3.4.0 either. I am at the moment trying to figure out what has changed, and why, but, if you want to try with higher versions, try it, and try to figure it out. Betaflight 3.2.2 works with a minimum of effort to get your craft flying. In the future, I want to experiment with GPS rescue for tricopter, which Betaflight 3.2.2 does not support, so I am going to go foward to version 3.4.1 which supports GPS rescue, and start there. If you power down the board, press the bootloader button on the Matek F411 flight controller, and plug back in like a lot of other boards, it does not enter bootloader mode, and there is NO blinking led confirming bootloader mode, at least with my windows 10 laptop. It does not work. If computer can't detect it, reinstall DFU drivers with zadig or use this https://impulserc.blob.core.windows.net/utilities/ImpulseRC_Driver_Fixer.exe To enter bootloader mode in CLI: In CLI Type bl enter Then bootloader mode is enabled, and newer firmware can be flashed. Do a full CLI dump, to have a reference to the original file before making ANY changes. You may need a fixed starting point in case you have to start over. You must assign it to be a tricopter &quot;first&quot;, and then &quot;save and reboot&quot; it as a tricopter so that all resources, and their designations will show up in the CLI. Setup: The first servo output channel is used for tail servo The first motor output channel is used for tail motor The second motor output channel is used for right motor The third motor output channel is used for left motor. The 2 front motors face forward and (tail) rear motor / servo facing towards you. On the board: Motor 1 - (rear) to motor output pin S1 Motor 2 (right) to motor output pin S2 Motor 3 (left) to motor output pin S3 Motor 4 motor output pin S4 is free, as this is a Tricopter. Motor pin 4 will not work for tail servo due to timing issue. (Tail servo setup is explained below, keep reading) If you need more outputs for servos, or as I needed strobes, motor 4 (S4) can't be remapped to servo if motor 3 (S3) is assigned to a motor. If S5 is used for a servo, S6 can be remapped to a servo also. I used S5 for telemetry in Taranis. You can also use RSSI pad or LED pads for servo outputs. I chose to try to disable motor 4, and noticed that I lost motor 2 when I tried to calibrate the esc's due to some Betaflight strangeness. I re-asigned motor 4 back to the original assignment, and motor 2 worked again, no problems. Go figure... In the BetaFlight GUI in the Receiver Tab is a selection for how the connection to the model is setup. Betaflight Defaults to AETR1234 Aileron, Elevator, Throttle, Rudder(yaw) Aux 1 2 3 4. This is an accepted standard setup on Taranis. In the Configuration tab: feature SERVO_TILT feature CHANNEL_FOWARDING Need to be OFF. Selecting TRICOPTER sets yaw output to servo automaticly. How to set the tail servo: I chose to use pin 6 in my setup for tail servo, as pin 5 in my setup is used for telemetry, as I stated earlier. In the CLI: Type resource motor 6 none save Then the pin will be free. Pin on board is S6, and B10 is the location of the pin. Type: resource servo 1 B10. save Nothing needs to be changed in the Servos tab for movement. Do not draw power from the board with a servo especially on a tricopter. Positive, black negative are going to a pdb 5v output. The yellow or white wire, signal wire can be connected to motor pin 5, motor pin 6, 7 or 8, will work. IF you want to disable the tail servo when it`s not armed, go to the CLI. Type: set tri_unarmed_servo = OFF save Or if you want it on. Type: set tri_unarmed_servo = ON save Now check if your servo/motor are tilting in the correct direction. If you move your yaw stick to the left, the motor must tilt to the right. If not, there are 2 ways to fix this. In CLI: Type Set yaw_control_direction = -1 save If you quickly move your tail to the right the motor must tilt quickly to the left, and vice versa. You can just reverse the yaw direction on your Tx, but it is better to do it in the GUI, so the flight controller does not have to process the data. Set the endpoints in the GUI so you have 40 degrees deflection in both directions, and neutral at as level as you can get it. An analog servo works as will a digital one in most cases my directions were not reversed with an analog servo, but may be with a digital. Hopes this helps. Cheers!!!

The red led should flash at startup, and then flash if the board is rotated from level if the firmware is running. If not, force DFU mode with the boot pins and reflash with &quot;No reboot sequence&quot; enabled. The wrong drivers are installed. Zadig should be used to install only the DFU mode driver. Connect in DFU mode with the boot pins, and then install the driver listed in post #1. Additional instructions are here. The default Windows drivers should work for VCP mode. how do I configure the vtx like change channels?​ Stick commands are shown on the OSD startup screen. Mid throttle, yaw left and roll centered, pitch up. Can the Typhoon's stackable Vtx's power, band, and channel be controlled/adjusted via the radio/goggles? Asking because I'm trying to decide between it and a tbs Unify, which has SmartAudio. Could only see reference to controlling the power via dipswitches and band/channel via CLI commands.​ The Typhoon band and channel can be selected through the Betaflight OSD or CLI. Power selection is on the switches, although there is a power setting in the OSD that affects the RF preamp gain and not the power amp gain. The Typhoon FC is intended for use with the VTX specifically. It won't connect easily to other VTXs. The Tempest F4 is designed specifically for use with a Unify Pro and comes with a custom cable for that. The Tempest has the OSD and SD card on the FC board also.

Betaflight 4.0 will be the culmination of years of work that started in 2016 with the introduction of remappable resources, and it will drastically change the way how Betaflight is built and distributed. To you as the user, not much in how you download and install the Betaflight firmware will change, but you will get some noticeable improvements: we’ll have to spend less time on maintaining and releasing the firmware, meaning that we’ll have more time to work on new and exciting features;manufacturers will have an easy way to release custom configurations for all of their boards and ready-to-fly (including RX setup and tuning) craft based on original Betaflight firmware - you will no longer be stuck on using old firmware, or recreating your configuration from scratch;the tinkerers amongst you will be able to share Betaflight firmware with your home built improvements amongst your friends without having to build and distribute separate targets for everybody’s board. (These changes are planned for F4 and F7, F3’s flash space limitations mean we won’t be able to fit all of this in.) We are almost there with the implementation of these changes, but since they are quite complex, and getting ‘almost there’ doesn’t buy us much, we have decided that we need to take more time to complete them, make sure the way users can use the firmware still works as expected, and properly test the new firmware. For this reason we have decided to postpone the planned release date for Betaflight to 01 April 2019. We will keep doing monthly releases of Betaflight 3.5 with bugfixes and new / updated targets in the meantime. To get the latest update from us, you can now also visit our webpage at https://betaflight.com/. In addition to the drastic changes mentioned above, Betaflight 4.0 will have a number of other exciting new features and improvements: yet again improved flight performance;'Launch control' mode;switchable profiles for the OSD layout.

Then on next update do this again to a new text file. This allows you to check for differences by either manually compared the two text files or by using an Difference option in a text editor. NotePad++ is one such editor with a good difference feature. If not in this Wiki then it is probably not a feature new to BetaFlight and you need to look in the CleanFlight Docs.

Betaflight is a Cleanflight fork started by BorisB. It used to work as a beta test platform for Cleanflight and kept pushing the envelope in terms of performance, but it eventually evolved into a fully grown up, stable and well maintained firmware by various developers. In fact it looks like it is the number 1 open source multi-rotor firmware according to Google Trends analysis around January 2017. The name &quot;Beta&quot; comes from the fact it started with a goal to keep trying new things out and have quick and easy test distributions available. The name &quot;Beta&quot; has stuck as the brand name was strong at the moment where it transitioned from beta to stable and there was already a lot of documentation around. &quot;This project also helps by contributing to other open source projects like iNav.&quot; - says Boris B (lead developer) 3Min video of Betaflight Evolution from Baseflight-&gt;Cleanflight-&gt;Betaflight "},{"title":"Tools​","type":1,"pageTitle":"MNR-MAGDALENA","url":"/docs/wiki/boards/MNR-MAGDALENA#tools","content":"Betaflight is also always being adjusted to support most current Cleanflight tools like Configurator and EzGui devices and many other MSP tools.

The SPI-connected MPU6000 inertial motion sensor was chosen for it's high reliability, accuracy and update speed. This board has no problem running fast loop times and ESC protocols. There is an onboard barometer for altitude sensing along with an On Screen Display (OSD) chip directly connected to the main processor (MCU). This tight integration between the MCU and the OSD enables fast updates to the display and easy configuration of the OSD, which is managed straight from the BetaFlight configuration tool. You no longer need to worry about the extra hassle of configuring your OSD with a USB/UART adapter and 3rd party configuration tool, it's all built into the flight control software. For maximum ease of use, the OmnibusF3 has an onboard voltage regulator that can easily handle up to a 5s battery. No need to mess with a PDB, just plug your battery straight into the flight controller and you're ready to go! Along with the robustly engineered power management system on the OmnibusF3, special precautions have been taken to ensure that the sensitive OSD chip is well protected, so you don't have to worry about any problems with your OSD. No need to use a spark arrestor, even on 5s!

I'm not sure if the board I was working on is an &quot;old&quot; version. In any case, I remapped the Motor resources back to the mapping in 3.0.1 and the motors arm , etc.. You should check your mappings to be sure it the same issue; if it is the CLI commands below is what I entered into FC: Resource PWM 2 NoneResource PWM 3 NoneResource PWM 4 NoneResource PWM 5 NoneResource Motor 1 B04Resource Motor 2 B05Resource Motor 3 B00Resource Motor 4 B01Resource Motor 5 B08Resource PWM 2 A11Resource PWM 3 A12Resource PWM 4 A13Resource PWM 5 A14 I wasn't sure if the PWM's needed to be remapped but I had to free them to remap the Motors 1-4. Hope that helps. Posted by mixblast: I can also confirm that this fixed motors not spinning on 3.1.6 on my Singularity. Apparently it will be fixed in the next betaflight revision https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/2530 I have also submitted a pull request which lets us use Dshot on this target (not for motors 5-6 though).

Unpack DfuSE and the STM VCP Drivers into a folder on your Hardrive Download the latest Sparky release (cleanflight_SPARKY.hex) from: https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight/releases and store it on your Hardrive In your DfuSE folder go to BIN and start DfuFileMgr.exe Select: &quot;I want to GENERATE a DFUfile from S19,HEX or BIN files&quot; press OK Press: &quot;S19 or Hex..&quot; Go to the folder where you saved the cleanflight_SPARKY.hex file, select it and press open (you might need to change the filetype in the DfuSE explorer window to &quot;hex Files (*.hex)&quot; to be able to see the file) Press: &quot;Generate&quot; and select the .dfu output file and location If all worked well you should see &quot; Success for 'Image for lternate Setting 00 (ST..)'!&quot;  Put the device into DFU mode by powering on the sparky with the bootloader pins temporarily bridged. The only light that should come on is the blue PWR led. Check the windows device manager to make sure the board is recognized correctly. It should show up as &quot;STM Device in DFU mode&quot; under Universal Serial Bus Controllers If it shows up as &quot;STMicroelectronics Virtual COM&quot; under Ports (COM &amp; LPT) instead then the board is not in DFU mode. Disconnect the board, short the bootloader pins again while connecting the board. If the board shows up as &quot;STM 32 Bootloader&quot; device in the device manager, the drivers need to be updated manually. Select the device in the device manager, press &quot;update drivers&quot;, select &quot;manual update drivers&quot; and choose the location where you extracted the STM VCP Drivers, select &quot;let me choose which driver to install&quot;. You shoud now be able to select either the STM32 Bootloader driver or the STM in DFU mode driver. Select the later and install. Then flash the binary as below. In your DfuSE folder go to BIN and start DfuSeDemo.exe Select the Sparky Board (STM in DFU Mode) from the Available DFU and compatible HID Devices drop down list Press &quot;Choose..&quot; at the bootom of the window and select the .dfu file created in the previous step &quot;File correctly loaded&quot; should appear in the status bar Press &quot;Upgrade&quot; and confirm with &quot;Yes&quot; The status bar will show the upload progress and confirm that the upload is complete at the end  Disconnect and reconnect the board from USB and continue to configure it via the Cleanflight configurator as per normal "},{"title":"Via Device Firmware Upload (DFU, USB) - Mac OS X / Linux​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Board - Sparky","url":"/docs/wiki/boards/SPARKY#via-device-firmware-upload-dfu-usb---mac-os-x--linux","content":"These instructions are for dfu-util, tested using dfu-util 0.7 for OSX from the OpenTX project. http://www.open-tx.org/2013/07/15/dfu-util-07-for-mac-taranis-flashing-utility/ A binary file is required for DFU, not a .hex file.

Not normally required and it is considered safer to spin motors so bystanders can see that your quad is armed ESC_SENSOR - Prefer ESC telemetry data from a UART connection to the ESC as configured in the Ports tab Bidirectional DShot - Required for RPM filtering. Instead of only sending DShot commands to the ESC on the motor output connections the FC will also listen for return data from the ESC on the same wire note By default includes only RPM data but can be expanded with the dshot_edt CLI command to also enable ESC voltage, current and temperature data via DShot telemetry (requires newer BlueJay/AM32/BLHELI32 ESC firmware).Extended Dshot Telemetry (EDT) allows ESCs to return telemetry data over the signal wire without requiring additional UART connections. EDT allows for telemetry from 8-bit ESCs running BlueJay as well as 32bit ESCs running AM32 or BLHELI32. This simplifies wiring and FC configuration for pilots.

For running higher power VTXs, or basically most of the Digital options out there, you may see a 9/10/12V regulator (though 12V is recommended nowadays). caution If one or more of the regulators are overloaded, they may cause the rest of the electronics to not function properly, not function at all, or even destroy the regulation circuitry (in some cases the components connected to it as well). This is why it's important to make sure that the regulator is rated for the current draw of the components you're using.

However to make it perform the best, it runs at a lower speed than most of the rest (8KHz on the MPU6000, 3.2KHz on the BMI270) Invensense ICM42xxx/ICM20xxx - A newer option, spread in use when the MPU6000 went out of production for a little while.

It ran on 8-bit microcontrollers, like an arduino, and as the name suggests, using a literal gyro board from the Nintendo Wii controllers. It was a great start, but it was limited by the 8-bit microcontroller. The next step was to move to more powerful microcontrollers, and the flight controller software to do this was called Baseflight, which was a port of Multiwii to 32-bit microcontrollers. Due to some disagreements, the Baseflight project was forked into Cleanflight. Cleanflight was a norm for a pretty good while. For even further experimentation, Betaflight was forked from Cleanflight as a way to have more cutting edge features in a separate firmware option (thus the name). You also see a lot of the wiki having cleanflight mentioned, but we're working on getting everything up to date. Betaflight has since overtaken Cleanflight in popularity, and is now the most popular flight controller software out there, with a lot of features and very active development.

There are tutorials for that online, but it's usually as simple as holding down the button on the VTX for a few seconds on power up. "},{"title":"Digital VTXs​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Setup Guide","url":"/docs/wiki/getting-started/setup-guide#digital-vtxs","content":"Digital VTXs are a newer form of video system that is becoming more and more common. It's a bit more complicated than analog, and needs setup to get OSD and VTX control working. Start in the Ports Tab by enabling VTX (MSP + Displayport) as a peripheral on the UART that your VTX is connected to. It should automatically enable MSP as well. If you're on a version older than 4.4, you will only need to enable MSP and then follow further. Then in the Preset Tab, there are a few system-specific presets that you can use to make the setup easier: HDZero for 4.2/4.3 and 4.4Avatar 4.2/4.3FPV.WTF MSP OSD 4.2/4.3FPV.WTF + O3 + Avatar for 4.4 For further information on the newest firmware (4.4), please read the Release Notes "},{"title":"Motor Settings​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Setup Guide","url":"/docs/wiki/getting-started/setup-guide#motor-settings","content":"Compared to the other settings, motor settings are pretty simple. In the Motors Tab, start by setting the ESC/Motor Output dropdown to the correct protocol. This is usually DShot300 or DShot600 for most ESCs available nowadays. info Choosing the correct DShot speed: DShot300 is better for FCs with slower processors, like F411 boards. DShot600 is better for faster processors, like anything from the F7 family. F405 may work too, but it can cause too high of a CPI load when a lot of peripherals are in use The DShot speed also depends on the gyro (and thus also the PID loop) speed. If you have a gyro that runs at 8kHz (MPU6000), you can use DShot600. If you have a gyro that runs at 3.2KHz (BMI270), you should use DShot300. Using higher DShot speeds on slower gyros shoudn't cause any issues, but it also won't give you any benefits Once you have that set, you will have to remove the propellors (if you haven't already) and plug in a battery. Click the checkbox to confirm that you have done so, and then you can slowly raise the Master slider to see the motors spin up. They may stutter a bit at low slider values, but should spin up smoothly at slightly higher values. Check that the motors all spin in the correct direction as set by the Motor direction is reversed toggle (also known as Props in or Props out, see image below). If they are spinning in the wrong direction, you can reverse them in the Motor direction sub-menu. If the motors do not match up with the motor numbers, you will have to remap them "},{"title":"Mode Settings​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Setup Guide","url":"/docs/wiki/getting-started/setup-guide#mode-settings","content":"Modes serve as a way to change the behavior or action of your quadcopter in flight by using AUX channels as inputs. In the Modes Tab, you will see a list of all the modes that are available. Let's start with the only one you theoretically need: The ARM mode serves as a way to activate the PID loop and allow the motors to spin. It is usually set to a switch. Click on Add Range. This will add a slider to the mode, which you can use to set the range of the mode. It's a range of two values, and when the value of the assigned AUX channel is between those two values, the mode will be active. By default the range will be in the middle, so it will be active when the AUX channel is between 1300 and 1700The dropdown that says AUTO is for the AUX channel selection. When set to AUTO, it will automatically select the AUX channel you change. So flip the switch you want to use to arm the quad, and the dropdown will change to that channel. If you want to use a different channel, you can select it manuallyThe little indicator on the bottom of the slider will show you the value of the AUX channel. Flip the switch into the position you want to arm the quad, and move the range over the indicator Once you have the range set, then repeat the process for the other modes. You will likely also want: BEEPER - Makes the beeper (and the motors, when set up) beep ANGLE tip The default flight mode is called acro (sometimes called rate mode). As the name suggests, it's a mode where the position of the sticks controls the rate of rotation of the quad. This is the mode you will want to use for most of your flying. Activating any other flight mode overrides acro. Angle mode is a mode where the position of the sticks controls the angle of the quad. This is useful for emergency situations, or for beginners who are not comfortable with acro mode yet FLIP OVER AFTER CRASH - Reverses the motors to flip the quad over if upside down danger This can be very demanding on the motors and the ESC if the motors are stuck after crashing, and can cause the ESC or motors to go up in smoke. It's recommended to only use this mode if you know it's more or less safe to do so "},{"title":"OSD Settings​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Setup Guide","url":"/docs/wiki/getting-started/setup-guide#osd-settings","content":"The OSD allows you to display information in the video feed from your quadcopter. In the OSD Tab, you can set up the different elements that will be displayed. You have a list of all the elements on the left, and three columns of checkboxes next to it. Each culumn is for one OSD profile. OSD profiles are a way to have different layouts for different situations and be able to easily switch between them. Enabling the checbox for an element in the first column will enable it for the first OSD profile, the second column for the second OSD profile, and so on. When you enable an element, it will show up in the preview, and you can drag it around to move it as you like. There are also some settings for specific elements, such as selecting units of measurement, the source for the timers to time, and different warnings to display or ignore You should have at least the following elements enabled: Warnings - Displays warnings for low battery, low RSSI, and other thingsBattery average cell voltage - Displays the average cell voltage of the battery, regardless of the number of cellsLink quality, RSNR Value, RSSI Value, RSSI dBm Value - Different ways of measuring the strength and/or quality of the radio link.
