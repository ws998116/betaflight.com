If the motors are maxing out during rapid yaw changes, the best solution is to just target a lower peak yaw rate, or be a bit more gentle in acquiring that rate.

Unfortunately, anytime no data is sent, FF drops abruptly to zero. The result is a very steppy FF trace during small inputs, and a reduction in fine control. Disabling the ADC filter will force the radio to transmit whatever data it has, new data every packet, no matter how small the change. This means transmitting some jitter but improves fine control and cleans up the FF trace a lot. The Hall effect gimbals have very little jitter and the ADC can be turned off without problems.
