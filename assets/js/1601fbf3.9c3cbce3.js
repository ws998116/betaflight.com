If upgrading from 2.1 you will have to copy in the new file structure for 2.2 to the sd card - back your sd card up first.\nThe early bf 3.1 releases do have SmartAudio selectable in the ports tab but don't necessarily work, so update to the latest bf.\nInstall the lua scripts linked from the bf wiki (x7, x9 as appropriate) into the scripts folder on the Taranis sd card.\nAttach the vtx audio lead to either uart 1 or 3 tx pin (RG SSD FC - Connect to the UART available on the FC you use).\nSelect tbs SmartAudio for the appropriate UART in the ports tab.\nGo to display in the Taranis and set a screen to 'scripts' it should then offer you the lua script you installed earlier.\nFrom the main model screen a long press of page will bring up the bf scripts and you press menu to cycle to the vtx screen.\nUpdate from elmattbo:\nSo after trying it today I found that the vtx didn't respond to changes in the lua script. Tried a power reboot after changing settings but it made no difference. I suspect I'm missing something in the set up, but it could be that the taranis reads the vtx, but doesn't write any changes. I have read that the half wave duplex (or whatever it is) communications protocol took a little figuring out for the devs so the issue may be in betaflight too."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,'Fixed!
